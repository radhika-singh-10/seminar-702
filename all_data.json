Ultimately, this decision will depend on the individual student and their ability to take advantage of the opportunities available to them.. \n\nHowever, in the end, the effect that home-based classes will have on learning is largely dependent on the situation of the student. On the other hand, there could be a lack of social interaction with classmates, a lack of guidance from instructors, and potential technical issues as well. For example, those who are already motivated to learn and are self-disciplined may reap the full benefits of studying in the comfort of their own home. Conversely, for those who require more interaction and guidance that comes with physical classrooms, a home-based learning style may not be as effective. On the one hand, it eliminates the need for physical attendance to classrooms, reduces the psychology of peer pressure, and eliminates potential health risks resulting from attending crowded places. In addition, students have the opportunity to arrange their learning environment according to their preferences and better manage their own time. \nWhen considering the pros and cons of attending classes from home, there is no doubt that there are a variety of advantages and disadvantages",

I think this idea is amazing, workers would have a day off and they won't be wasting energy and resources like in a regular day of work. By following this idea, my school would conserve energy and a lot of resources such as papers, school materials, food, etc.\n\nA four-day school week benefit students and teachers in many ways, students would have a day off and time to do extra curricular activities such as sports or work, teachers would be at home and have time to spend with their kids and be with the family, and all of us would be conserving energy and resources. Therefore i think my school should follow this model and extend the school day two hours in a four-day school week. Students would be happy of having a day off, and most of them would support the idea of having a four-day school week. My mom, she doesn't work, she is always at home taking care of me and my little brother, for my parents, it wouldn't be a problem for me to have four days of school a week, because my mom would take care of me during that day off.\n\nIn conclusion, i think having a four-day school week, would benefit a lot of people, because just like me, there are plenty of students that would love to work more and generate money, and for the teachers, well they would enjoy have a day off and spend time with their kids at home.. Four-day work week, a remarkable idea to conserve energy and resources, some businesses have adopted the idea of a four-day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours. One disadvantage of having a four-day school week is that some parents work 5 days a week in different companies and these companies might not have the four-day work week so they won't have time to be with their kids at home in the day off, and some of them would be forced to change their five-day work week to a four-day work week, so they can be with their kids at home.\n\nPersonally, i would prefer the four-day school week, because,i have a part-time job after school , it is from 5 to 10pm, and having a day off would allow me to have time to do some extra work at home and to change my schedule for in the morning so i can have the rest of the day to work on my stuffs, have time to chill, or maybe to do my homework, and help my mom with whatever she needs.\n\nHaving a four-day school week, would let me have time to do a lot of things during the day, for example, babysit my little brother if my mom goes out, go to the gym or maybe help my dad",

Additionally, it may be difficult to plan certain events such as field trips, sports games, and Parent-Teacher Conferences. Additionally, students would also be provided with an extended weekend, reducing the amount of stress they experience during the week. \nOne of the primary arguments for implementing a four-day school week is the potential cost savings. \n\nUltimately, while a four-day school week may have some benefits, a thorough assessment of both the advantages and disadvantages must be taken into consideration before implementing it at a school. \n\nHowever, there are several potential drawbacks as well. Many schools are currently operating at a budget deficit and a four-day week could help those districts by reducing the amount of money spent on utilities, staff, and transportation. Furthermore, a four-day school week may also increase the likelihood of teachers needing to miss class and disrupt lesson plans. For instance, students may struggle to stay motivated and focused with the extra day off",

He was really surprised that I didnt gave up, and after that he told me I made the team as a starting defensive tackle.\n\nIn conclusion this is why I strongly agree that failing is a key to success, without failure we as human beings would not be able to improve in our day to day life. I started feeling really hopeless but I still did not gave up and kept working harder and harder. I started playing football in my freshman year in high school. It is because of failing which keeps us successful, and makes us humans work harder for what we want in life.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGeneric_Name         . Last day of the tryouts the coach came up to me, and told me that he was really proud of me. Dear Winston Churchill,\n\nI strongly believe that, failure plays a huge role in pursuing success, and I have a personal story and also information to back up my statement \"that failing is the key to success\".\n\nThe news article of daily life, had a section dedicated to failing is a key to success, in that portion it talks about how the most successful people in the world had to fail so many times and hardship in that portion of the article it interviews Bill Gates and he quote on quote said that \"failing thought me that you have to try harder and harder every time you fail in order to successed\", and without failing he would not be the CEO of Google.\n\nI personally have experienced how failing is the key to success. So I got cut from the team but I did not listen to what my coach said to me. I was doing really bad during team practice, and one day my coach came up to me and told me that I should quit football, and how it was not the right sport for me. When sophomore season came up and we had to go through tryouts in order to make the team. On my junior season it was time for the football tryouts once again. I was trying so hard to get a starting position on the football team. I was doing really good in the first two days of the tryouts but then I started doing really bad on the third day, and then the coach came up to me on the last day of the tryouts, and told me that I did not make the team. I started doing really good, and the coaches were really impressed of what I was capable of doing",

And not just small setbacks \u2013 individuals like Thomas Edison, for example, demonstrated the huge leaps of progress that can made from grappling with mistakes, which ultimately became the foundation for some of his most impressive accomplishments. It was not until I looked at the mistakes I made that I could understand what I was doing wrong and make necessary changes in my studying approach. \n\nIn conclusion, it is clear that failure can be a powerful stepping stone to success. Prominent successful individuals serve as examples of how mistakes can lead to great accomplishments. His famous quote, \u201csometimes life hits you in the head with a brick,\u201d serves as a reminder that failure is a necessary challenge to encounter when striving for greater success. Furthermore, by reflecting on our own life experiences, we can understand the significance of failure in helping us grow and reach our goals. For example, Apple Co-founder Steve Jobs was famously fired from the company he helped build, only to return and lead it to even greater success. As such, it is crucial to embrace failure in any endeavor in order to reach true success.. By exploring specific real-world examples of prominent successful individuals, exploring the relationship between failure and success, and looking at my own life experiences, I will demonstrate that experiencing failure can be an essential step towards success. This is evidenced by the countless prominent successful individuals who have experienced numerous struggles on their path to success. I, for one, have experienced numerous failures while working towards a goal. \n\nThis essay aims to address how failure can ultimately be a key element to achieving success. In particular, while preparing for my college entrance exams, I was faced with many challenges and failed the first few tests.

It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.\" Do we accomplish more if we are always not doing something productive? No, being inactive won't help accomplish nothing just by standing or laying down at home doing nothing.

People would learn more things, meet new people to achieve goals in life and how much can be done if we are always doing something.\n\nPeople would learn more things if they are more productive. Thats why they go inactive but still accomplish their goal on a long term time. Although, we can accomplish more if we are always doing something. Inactivity also can also serve a purpose, depending on the person maybe they dont got money or a transportation vehicle to get to their destination.

I didn't know I was going to be joining a soccer team, or wanted to play on the soccer team;however, I did it and I learn how to kick a soccer ball, how to be a golly and I improved my speed.

Although being inactive won't help accomplish nothing just by standing or laying down at home doing nothing. when we get some free time we can work on something that would help us in the future and make us think better.

When considering this quote, it\u2019s important to strike a balance when pursuing our goals. Making a plan to accomplish our goals and having the dedication to complete it can bring amazing results. Doing something shows dedication and passion for our goals while doing nothing might make us miss out on important progress. It\u2019s essential to be both active and restful in order to have balance and obtain our goals in life.. If we are idle for too long and do not put effort into our goals, they may remain stagnant and we might miss out on opportunities. In addition, too much inactivity can lead to laziness, apathy and depression. By doing too much, we can exhaust ourselves and affect our mental and physical health.

loved soccer just like me.\n\nEverytime I had went to Florida to go visit family me and my grandfather we would always watch soccer games and tell me some formation to play when I grow up.\n\nThe favorite things that my grandfather love to do was drawing, playing soccer and teach me some new moves.\n\nEvery morning we would wake up he will always take me and my brother to waffle house and we would tell some stories to me and my brother about what he did when he was growing up.\n\nWhen he had fell and went to the hospital I was not but when my mom face time my aunt he found out that we could not move body shoulders down and then he had to get some brain surgies and all that then the week after all that he had died and we face timed my aunt and he prayed on the phone and we all was crying.\n\nI had a soccer game the day after he died and I had scored 6 goals and every time I had scored I had always kissed my hand and point it up to the sky.\n\nAfter the game I was crying because I was proud of my self that I played a game with all that stress over my shoulders and I said to my self I did that for my grandfather.\n\nThen right after the game my mom had came to me and started crying because I told her that I was going to score 6 goals just for my grandfather and I did what I said I was going to do.\n\nThat night I was praying and telling my grandfather that I had scored 6 goals just for him and I was saying to my head that I was going to do that more often.\n\nMy next soccer game I had scored 5 goals but every time I go on the pitch I had always kissed my chain and touched the ground and point at the sky and I still do that today.\n\nMy soccer game in 2 more weeks and I am going to do what I need to do to take my team to the championship and I will play all my soccer games just for my grandfather.\n\nAll the soccer games I play they will always be for my grandfather and he will never forget that and if I have to do anything just to get some goals I will then just for him.\n\nWhen I was in Florida my grandfather had bought me a soccer poster and a soccer jersey of my favorite soccer player.\n\nHe had got a jersey customize for that say my last name and my favorite which is number 7 and that is my favorite soccer player number to.\n\nWhen I was little he had always send me some of his drawing and like always write a little back that say I will always love u miyo and miyo mean son.\n\nWhen I was 10 years old he came down here to Virginia and he was visiting and he will always wake up at 4 o clock in the morning to go fora bike ride and when he came back he had always fix breakfast for us.\n\nIn the afternoon he will always 1 v 1 me or my brother in soccer for some money like 10 dollars but that is if we beat him do.\n\nThis why I play soccer just because of him.\n\nLike when I get frustrated in the soccer game I will always take a deep breath and think about my grandfather and that is what always calm me down when I get frustrated.\n\nHe had always tell me if someone is talking trash always smile because that dont talk the most is the most strong ones in the game and I always tell them look at the score board.\n\nHere go the reason why I would like to go to Florida:\n\nFamily and my grandfather grave.\n\nI would like to go to Generic_City studios.\n\nGo to the beach and get some nice weather.\n\nIn conclusion, Where is one place you will like to visit?\n\nI would like to visit Florida because Florida have nice weather.\n\nFlorida is something special to me because I have family down in Florida.\n\nThe place I would like to visit is my grandfather grave.   .

Ultimately, it is up to the individual to determine whether it is possible to do something meaningful without the help and support of others.. In fact, there are many examples of individuals who have made significant contributions without any sort of supportive network. In this sense, going it alone is rarely a viable option, and as such, it is difficult to do something meaningful without the help and support of others.\n\nAt the same time, this does not mean that it is impossible to do something meaningful alone.

      "human_text": "Animation is very complex sometimes depending what type of animation am I doing. 3D animation is more realistic and it's a lot more complex than 2D because you have to model objects, humans and many others that I could add. Whenever I take a test, I will start to over think a lot and loose concentration. Personally, I took the SOL yesterday and I mostly doodle half of the test because I was over thinking too much. It could be very hard sometimes but it is still fun to do.. There are two main types of animation, 2D and 3D animation. In my opinion, the most enjoyable educational activity is art because it makes me less stressed out, I could find new styles, it could be my future career.\n\nFirst of all, it makes me less stressed out about everything. It is very enjoyable in my opinion and it really helps me through tough times in life. One...two...three...START! Identify an enjoyable educational activity such as doing the science fair, singing, playing an instrument and many others. In my opinion, it is really creative and it may also shows your feelings about life. It very amusing to me and interesting because it can tell a story about my life.\n\nAdditionally, it could be my future career. It helps me a lot and make me concentrate more often now by doing a simple thing like doodling.\n\nSecond, I could find new styles in my art. Art is mostly my favorite enjoyable educational activity in school and many other places. 2D animation is more like a picture and many cartoons use 2D animation. Mostly my future job would be an animator since I've drew so much in my life.\n\nI love doing art because it makes me less stress out about everything, I could find new styles in art, and it could be my future career. It may be really complex for me but I still try my best to get the hang of it. One of my friends have sleep paralysis and most of the time she draws about how it feels like to have sleep paralysis. 2D animation is more like just drawing on a piece of paper while on the other hand, 3D I had to mostly use a program for to just do 3D animation. I was stressing out really bad yesterday and I just doodled on my paper. It's very interesting sometimes and very fun to do. I am a self-taught artist and I like trying out new styles. There are many art programs in college and I'm mostly interested in doing animation. I always doodle on my notes, my work, and my test because it's really fun in my opinion. Since drawing is my favorite thing to do in life it could be easy for me to get a job that deals with art. Most of the time, I will always doodle on my paper because it lets me concentrate more and loose my mind a bit. Most of the time it is hard to find a job that you want and it takes time and hard work to get it. I could draw how it's like to be scared of the dark or being scared of heights. I mostly take a break whenever I'm taking a test just to calm myself down a bit and doodle",

This is particularly important from a mental health standpoint, as we can often find ourselves dealing with anxiety and even depression due to various life experiences.\n\nThe skills and knowledge one can gain from an art-based education can also be incredibly useful in pursuing a career. It provides numerous mental and physical benefits and can play an instrumental role in people finding their career paths and discovering their passions..

Some people think that spending more time at school would be a good idea because students would have more time to study.

Students hang out with family and friends. Some of this students would be also constantly tired of spending too much time at school and then going to work.\n\nAnother reason why school days should only be eight hours long and not ten is because students would not have enough time to do their daily activities.

Even some students help their family to either clean or any other thing that has to be done at home. Some students are already tired in the 4th hour of school. School should not extend the school days more than eight hours.

For example one day at my school students got into agreement saying that they are happy with the school menus that they have those why many students do not skip classes. And others student say the food should stay the same because they like it and it healthier for them. changing school food will be good idea and also bad because same students want same food they have now day but other want change and those where all arguing start. Otherwise many students will not go to their class or lunch because they skip class to go buy food. Other students may not like the idea of changing because they think the new change will worst then they have.\n\nIf schools change to healthier food for students many student will be in the class to learn and stop thinking about skiing class to go buy food. For example one of my classmate always goes out to from school during class to buy food and i ask him why he said the school food are not good enough for him and those the problem he skip class to go to buy food. Other people think that many students get sick when they eat school food and many students are not learning and they do not go to classes in time or they skip same periods. Many students at my school argue that the food should change. The good way to make students happy about is to keep the one they most like and get ruined of the one they do not like.\n\nSome may argue that changing school menu would be bad idea because the new menu would be something that the students may not like do or not healthier for them. And change for those who agree with the idea. Otherwise it will clause same problem for school principal.. The school food should change because a lot of students they did not like it and many students feel sick when they eat school food and many students skip their lunch to go and buy food from stores if schools provides the same food for student many students will leave class and learn they will not lean anything for being late in the class and more.\n\nThe school lunch should to be healthier for student to eat.

For example, a study conducted at a high school in California found that students who ate school lunches had higher grades than those who brought their own.\n\nOn the other hand, changing the school menu may present more challenges than benefits. Additionally, some students may require additional dietary accommodations that may not be available in the new menu. On one hand, providing students with healthy meals provides the essential nutrients and energy needed to focus in class and refrain from getting sick. Studies have shown that students who regularly eat healthful school lunches tend to have higher grade point averages and miss fewer days of school.

This is a good intention from curfews, to protect them at the end the only beneficiaries are the teenagers.\n\nFor example if they are in the middle of the night they can get a trouble , because they going to do wherever they want when nobody is watching them, for other part if curfews say not they have to respect the rules .\n\nOtherwise nobody are in the street playing or doing something good in the night, all people are in home resting or with their family doing other things, they have to apply the same for teenagers.\n\nAlso in the night someone can steal your properties, or doing something bad to someone or to you , why? to you because maybe you are watch what others are doing to someone, and you try to help or do something.\n\nSome people thing that have fun in the night is good idea.  . but is not, for examples going to the clubs is not good in my opinion, because you don't not anybody ,or something can happen ,for example in Las Vegas almost 3 years ago someone shooting a club in the middle of the night many people die. In conclusion curfews have to take care of the teenagers this is good for them",
      "ai_text": "It appears that curfews can be useful in keeping teenagers out of trouble in some cases, however, they can also interfere with their rights and limit their activities in other cases. They are often instituted by governments or private organizations such as schools, in order to protect teenagers from engaging in risky or illegal behavior. On the other hand, there are also cases where curfews have had a detrimental impact on young people. For example, in the city of Oakland, California, local officials observing a decrease in crime in areas where the curfew was introduced. The efficacy of curfews ultimately depends on the particular situation and context in which they are instituted.. \n    Curfews are laws or regulations that restrict the movement of teenagers in public places during certain hours of the day, usually at night. On the other hand, opponents of curfews argue that restricting movement of young people unfairly interferes with their basic rights, and stifles creativity and personal development.\n\nIn some cases, curfews have been effective in curbing juvenile crime in particular areas. For instance, in the United Kingdom, an 11pm curfew introduced during the coronavirus outbreak has had adverse effects on teenagers' mental health, with some feeling isolated and lonely due to the lack of social contact.\n\nIn conclusion, there are both advantages and disadvantages associated with curfews. \n\nProponents of curfews argue that they reduce the likelihood of crime and that they can also act as a parental tool for monitoring their child's activities",

After some years they finally got everything they needed and they had two kids and finally got to know that they will have a better future.\n\nLast, people can feel more positive. Do you agree with Churchill's statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success? If the statement about the role that failure plays in the pursuit of success, it could help people to do better things. For example, my cousin Generic_Name had a soccer game at Generic_City, she and her team was talking about how they will need to play on the field, they needed to play better than the other games because the team that she was going to play against is one of the best teams that plays on that field and also her team needed to have more goals scores to keep being on the list so the can win the championship, so when they started to play they was playing like they planned it before the game and at the end of the game they won and everyone was happy because they never thought that they was going to have the chance to win that team, but they never give up.\n\nNext, people can have a better future. For example, when my cousin talk to her coach about that I wanted to be in a team of soccer, the coach called me and told me that he wanted me to play soccer with his team the next weekend, but before that I told him that I was not that good at playing soccer and he told me that I will learn easier and faster if I go to practices, so when I went to my first game I was so nervous about that I was not going to play good as the other girls do, and I did not wanted them feel bad if we lose for my fault, but I kept playing and I never thought that at my first game I was going to make a goal, but overall I kept going from failure to failure and never loss my enthusiasm and that is one of the reasons that helped me feel more positive of myself.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that going to failure to failure will not loss the enthusiasm, at the same time it could be one of the betters reasons by making people do things better, make people have a better future, and also people can feel positive by them self.. Also people can feel more positive.\n\nFirst, people can do better things",

Identifying with this idea, I think of a time in my life when I failed and subsequently achieved success: when I got a low grade on a maths test, I worked harder to properly understand the material and ultimately did well in the following tests.

My mom teach my how to behavior and that I have to respect the older peoples but she don't choose how my character it gonna be\n\nIn other words some peoples make us strong like my mom she teach me how to be strong too, and some peoples teach you that how to be strong but they don't choose how we gonna be how we gonna act, they can't teach us or change us our character we are the only person who decided If we need to change our character, however sometimes we need to change our character and that is gonna help us in the school in the house and in the life, and a person who is very respectful nice and have a good character is very important because what happened if you are angry have a bad character in the work nobody is gonna like to work with you the same happened in the school, if we have a bad character nobody is want to work with us that why sometimes is very important to change our character\n\nThe last reason but not the less important is without a doubt sometimes is important to changes our character like for example, my English teacher have some students that they don't care about the class, and she need to change her character in the class so that way the students stop talking and distracting the class, and when she change is character they stop to talk because she put angry and rude, but however she never change her character she always are happy she only change the character when the students are talking or playing in the class but they don't change the teacher character she change her own character\n\nNobody can change our character we decides if we change or not, sometimes it is important to make some changes to be a better person, and to help our self or to help other people, a person with a good attitude and with a good character always is gonna be good work with them we need to know when we need to change, and why we need to change and that is gonna help us for the life and for everything and always it is important to smile..

      "human_text": "People can learn from past mistakes by seeing what went wrong and practice doing better at it; for example, in a show called\n\nMasterchef, chefs must impress the judges by their skills in cooking but one chef gets eliminated every episode. When I took the test I was nervous and failed by one question, but i checked the answers I got wrong and studied them a bit more and passed the next time I took it. The permit test is something big for teens since it is something related to their future. Another example is taking the permit test as a teenager. I agree with Michelangelo because you learn from past mistakes, you learn to take risks, and having bigger goals help you improve ones self.\n\nMichelangelo is a great artist because of his work, but he learned from his own work to keep moving forward. Setting a bigger aim and failing is best because you learn from your mistakes, you learn to take risks, and bigger goals help improve ones self. I believe that taking risks are better than small decisions even if those risks don't turn out the way you wanted them too. Michelangelo rather fail by doing something big than his life than doing something small and achieving it. These examples prove that you have the ability to learn from past mistakes, grow as a person, and that you might have to take risks in doing so.\n\nTaking risks are mostly involved in big decisions that involve jobs, education,etc. When a chef gets eliminated their dreams may get crushed, but they had the courage to go on and did their best and can learn what they did wrong. In a show called Shark Tank, people come in to persuade investors to invest in their products, but they do not always succeed. Bigger goals are better because of how much they help you improve.\n\nA great artist once said it is great danger setting a small aim for yourself. It is best to have a meeting in person than online because it is not as easy so you get challenged and the person interviewing can know you better and you can most likely get the position. In today's society, many people agree that having a simple goal and achieving it is better than having a huge goal and failing to achieve it, but i disagree. If you learn to take risks, you later get use to it and you can speak more in front of people and state your opinion. Setting a higher aim for yourself is better because you can improve your skills and knowledge. In conclusion, setting a bigger aim and failing is alright and better than setting a small aim due to it being more easy.. He stated this thought because he failed and made mistakes before he was known as a great artist. It is best to challenge yourself so that you are ready for anything that comes your way. One of the greatest artists, Michelangelo, said that setting our aim too low and achieving it is a great danger for some of us. Taking risks can make you a better person as a whole and those mistakes can help you improve.\n\nMichelangelo and I agree that having a bigger goal and failing is better than having a small goal and achieving it. Even if you take the high route and fail, it does not mean you can try again. People view their mistakes and overcome it so they can do better next time. Having a bigger goal can increase your confidence and help you put your head in the task you want to overcome. Another example is having a meeting for a job. The people who do not get investments keep moving forward and take their own risks to get a investor. Small goals do not involve much effort and work as bigger achievements; by choosing to accomplish a simple task, you as a person may get use to the easy way out and can get lazy over time. Smaller aims are a scapegoat compared to bigger aims because of how much easier they are",
      "ai_text": "As Michelangelo said, \u201cThe greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark.\u201d Taking risks can make us better people, and can help us to reach heights we might not have achieved otherwise.. Taking risks and failing can be intimidating and even frightening, but it is often necessary in order to achieve greater successes. \nThroughout his life, Michelangelo was an advocate for setting ambitious goals and taking risks, regardless of the outcome. He said, \u201cThe greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark.\u201d This sentiment resonates today as we look to examples of taking risks and setting big goals. Taking a risk and studying hard, you take the test with the anticipation and fear of failure looming in the back of your mind. \n\nOn a more personal level, many of us can look to our own lives for examples. \n\nOne example can be seen in the popular television show Masterchef. Here, contestants put it all on the line in a high-stakes cook-off, showing the importance of setting big goals and having the courage to risk failure to achieve success. Perhaps you set a goal to pass your permit test. When you find out you have passed the test, you are rewarded with the satisfaction of having taken the risk, worked hard, and accomplished your goal.\n\nIn the end, it\u2019s important to take the advice of Michelangelo and others to heart",

I think everyone should first try to get along with someone and then, they can judge. This statement is false because you can't judge a person based on their appearance because sometimes people are just having a bad day and when you become friends with them you find out how that person actually is.\n\nFor example, you meet a person that has a lot of tattoos and you have a bad impression of them, but then, you interact with that person and you find out that he/she is not what you thought; therefore you can't judge a person based on their appearance. That's why I think that you can change first impressions.. It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. Also, what a lot of people don't understand is that everyone have problems and they don't know what other people are passing through.\n\nSometimes you have a bad impression of someone because of what other people say and the opinion you have on them do not change until you start talking to that person, I think that this an error that a lot of us make, we judge a person without knowing how they actually are. I think that how a person dresses doesn't determine the type of person someone is, but if you let someone to express their feelings your opinion on them will completely change.\n\nIn addition, when you become friends with someone and you talk with them, sometimes they tell you that when you met them, they weren't having a good day",
      "ai_text": "Fast forward to college, and we\u2019re now more like siblings than friends. We had completely different personalities and interests, so much so that we rarely shared a conversation, let alone became friends. \nFirst impressions can be deceiving, and sometimes it\u2019s not until we know someone better that we realize their true character. This knowledge often comes in the form of connecting with shared interests or gaining a true understanding of the other person\u2019s true character. \n\nOne example of this comes from my own personal experience. This in turn allows for the development of a meaningful relationship that alters the initial perception of the other persons traits. My best friend in high school was someone I initially thought I had nothing in common with. Understanding the true character of a person or gaining an understanding of shared interests has the potential to change the perception of a first impression, allowing for a strong connection.. In a study conducted in the journal Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, it was found that one\u2019s perception of another person can be modified with knowledge. Despite our different backgrounds \u2013 she was a first-generation immigrant from East Asia and I\u2019m from a rural background halfway across the world \u2013 we\u2019ve grown to understand each other and found areas of shared interest that have helped bond us closer than ever.\n\nThis is further supplemented by scientific evidence that supports the idea that first impressions can be changed. Despite popular belief, these first impressions can be changed over time. This is evident in my own personal experience, as well as in various scientific studies that have been conducted. \n\nIn conclusion, first impressions are not always accurate and can be changed",

It also feels good when collective aspects of the communities's characteristics; like values or common interests by which something is distinctly recognizable or known and is indivisible to the individual and so you start to feel proud of your community, much like patriotism or nationalism.\n\nBut you should have the freedom to instinctively or consistently question your community if it contains fundamental errors in reasoning.

Believing in yourself is always something that is gonna help you to a positive person.\n\nMaking good choices in your life is another part of you not just because sometimes you learn from them or where they could take you but how you get when you learn from your bad choices and how sometimes you react and you say to your self that you just want for your self to do good things.\n\nDont ever in your life say that your things are never worth of any tries you have made because the're really are worth of every single part of your life there are step you always take. theres another step where family comes along and you got to be able to take care of your family you got to get your family food you gotta get then clothes you gotta get them shoes you gotta get them the most important things they need and you still get your family out of any circumstances you still get up every morning to get your money and help your family or each other up and you still grow from not just growing from it but you also get to know how something people get to appreciate what you really do for them. Dont stop trying do not ever make yourself feel like you gotta do things for other people just be great how you are with or without mistakes you could be wonderful and make yourself happy and proud of them.\n\nIn life theres so many responsibilities you have to take care of and no matter what does responsibilities are you still take care of them you dont give up because if you do you wouldnt be able to go to school and becoming someone in life you wouldnt be able to to eat you wouldnt be able to work or to do many things but you stills do them because you have to and because you do become someone out of them you become a person that graduates a person that works everyday to put food in the table a person that after words its gonna be proud for they have done and that is always good enough and that you grow everyday from it. you could take a risk of many things you want to do in life and become something wonderful of it. honestly you grow of some many ways you didnt have no idea you could but you still get through it.\n\nbe someone in life is about growing little things you have left out to make them bigger. Happy is showing every body that no matter they think about you you dont pay any attention to them even if you have try your best to become friends and it still not even working out so you just gotta leave the person and just let it be you just gotta show the person that you did try and if for that person your friendship wasnt good enough then dont bother. being organist with your self is less stress full because you dont got worry about get so many things out of your way the same day. you can graduate and became someone you wanted to, thats growing masterly of no matter how many times you have try but where has got you.\n\nBe a person with so many mistakes but the also is going to learn from them and,you will still come back up and start trying again.\n\nIf you have done so many things and you still feel like no other person is going to appreciate of the things you have done and then you feel like theres nothing that you could do that could be good enough for nobody. you could become a person that could afford a car with nobody asking help and you grow everyday with or without people because you are strong like that",

Like for example, some of the school are diverse ethnic, students characteristics are diverse also, like some of the other likes to go shopping mall, likes to strolling anywhere, likes to bully others, likes to fight, likes to not go home after school instead go to other houses that they don't really even that much know, and many more characteristics.\n\nAlthough students will have benefits of attending classes from school, however, attending classes from home has much more benefits. For instance, there are some people that born in this world that are very naught, like even you defy him/her they will not listen to you and then sometimes, some of the other students will raise their pride and just walkout from their class because they don't want to listen any objection from their action. Attending classes from home by the way of online or video conferencing can really benefit to the students because one of the biggest benefits is that, they are more safer to study in their homes, they have a great time to focus in their studies, and they can avoid bad influence from others.. Another reason for home schooling is that, it's more safer for them to study. One of the reason also of homeschooling is that, they can avoid bad influence from others. Are you one of the students that is home schooled? If not, here are some of the benefits, why some students choose to attend classes in their home, by the way of online or video conferencing.\n\nSome people believe students will benefit from being able to attend classes from home, however, home school is a great way of student to attend classes because they can focus in their studies, it's more safer, and they can avoid bad influence from others.\n\nAttending classes through online or video conferencing has a lot of benefits like what I mention from the first paragraph, that homeschooling can help students to focus in their studies.

Without the distractions of other students or teachers, the student is able to stay focused on the content and work more efficiently. This reduces the worrying parents often have about their children being exposed to bad influences outside of home. \n\nAdditionally, online classes provide a level of focus that can be hard to replicate in a traditional classroom setting. \n\nMany parents who homeschool their children struggle to provide them in-person educational opportunities, especially with the already reduced resources available to homeschooled students. Online and video conferencing classes allow homeschooled students to access a variety of classes, often from the comfort and safety of their own home. \n\nAll in all, online and video conferencing classes are ideal for homeschooled students.

Everything will be destroyed and disgrace will follow you anywhere.\n\nDon't follow experts, be one of them and do your own life, have a family, have a car, an partment or whatever you want to have without asking anyone. Anyone else is just people we know. That's why you should live your life as you want to live it without anybody help. Do everything by yourself and don't let people make you feel useless because God make them the same as you and as everyone else but they have not develop their mental capacity the waht make them special. Life is going to beat you up, experiences will make you stronger every single day, decisions will make you be independent, and at the end you will see that everything you did was good and you have what you wanted without anybody help. Do not live like a robot, don't let anyone take adventage of your incapacity to succed just because you do not know anything. If you do everything by yourself people will try to destroy you but be strong and try even more until get what you want. Remember that just God and family are our friends. At first, you can have a teacher during a period of time but it doesn't mean that you will have to go and ask for help everytime you have a problem. Two years ago I met an old man from Washington DC, his name was Generic_Name. There's always going to be a person telling you what to do and if you don't follow his/her directions something could go wrong. Before homeless he was a mechanic but one day while he was fixing a car he met a person who told him that he could help him to have his own workshop and he accepted. Bussiness came down, deppression started to make him use drugs, and after a while he lost everything he had and the expert (person who help him) wasn't there to help him when he really needed him.\n\nIf you think you have the capacity to succed on your own, you have to do it and don't let anyone ruin what you have planned for your own future. Experts help you to get things but do you really think they will help you when you are really on trouble? or will they help you with things you have to pay? the answer to this is NO. Now, what can experts do to change their life or take the control of what they want to do?. A person help you to walk and talk and one time you learn this you become an indepentent person. The way they think and the way they look at other people make them specials and unique. If you put your life in hands of an expert you will have the opportunity to succed but it will feel strange and you will regret later. When I said human I mean that you will have your own thoughts about something and your own way to live your life and no like a robot that just follow direction and have no sense of humor.\n\nPeople will never discover their great mental power because until I know they just develop the 70.3% of their mental capacity and it makes them feel useless sometimes. Their decisions and their style of life before the actual I think were made by someone else and after a while they were not able to pay for what they had. Everything was good for the first years but after some years the person left the country and Generic_Name didn't have the capacity to manage the whole store. He gave you two arms, two legs, two eyes and a body. My friend, if you let people maneuver your life, then you will cry and you will not have the future you wanted. Do we have to live other people experiences?\n\nIf we want to live our own life you should start by taking a break. Ask questions, ask for advices and opinions but don't do want they want to do with your life. We all know that life isn't easy as we want but that's life, we cannot change it. Why? if you ask why, and this is because everything you have done it's thanks to someone else not to you, you are not living your own life, youar not having fun, no mistakes, no experiences, no control of your own life. Never try to kill yourself if you don't know what to do it is better if you believe in God and in his help because he is the only one who can help you without taking anything away from you.\n\nNever give up and follow your dreams, live your life as you want to live it but remember that no one can control what you can do if you don't want to. No matter what happen you have to do what makes you happy always just trusting God. Life depends of you and what you do with it. It doesn't matter if he is a proffesional, you just need to learn what you need but never let them maneuver your life. Help is given by God when you born. Make your own decisions mean that you will do mistakes but you will learn even more from this and it will help you to do thigs better and it also will help you like a human. Think how people would like to live their lifes and then, use this as an example but do not use it for your own. People will always try to control your life but you are the one who is going to decide if you want to live the life they want you to live or the one you want to live. I am not saying that you have to ignore the advices they give you but don't follow their directions.\n\nNothing is difficult if you really try it and nothing can be impossible if you really want to do it. I know life isn't easy to live but remember that we just have one and after death we cannot do anything about it.

This way we can understand the situation and whether or not if the people and their families to decide if it's a good idea.\n\nStudents can gain little experience by taking the class every each year, this way students can learn more about the Jobs they want to be in. I also think this is very important. If you take swimming class every year, and gain a little bit of experience, you will be able to win the swimming contest. All this reason is to proof of why gaining experience is a good thing and help you understand the job you wanted to applied for.\n\nGiving students the time to think on what jobs their most interested on is also very important for this prompt. Planning is really important for all of our lives. I really like this idea, it helps us understand what we're interested on and what to learn.

Swimming class exist to help people to not drown. It is called the Course Election, where students gets to pick three class that are interesting for them or forced to pick because it is a requirement. Many students have successfully acquired the jobs they intended to work because of how much work they put into to plan and learning the stuff they need to know on how to run the job. Because of that, planning has a big impact in our lives and helps us to decide on what jobs to do and to give us the time to think. For example, the military uses a plan and tactics in order for them to calculate and for the plan to be successful. That is why, students should select to visit and learn about the work that interests them because, it gives them more time to think, making plans for their future, and to gain experience through out the school years.\n\nStudents should be planning for their future and to decide which class to take in order for them to learn about the work that interests them.

I think three years is enough for students to plan and to have a little experience for their future.\n\nIn conclusion, student are more successful if they are to be picked for themselves instead of the school choosing for them, because the more they like the class and the job they are going for, the harder they will try to succeed.",

I told myself that everything its possible in life, you born for a purpose, not just because your mom wanted you to be born.\n\nThere was a time, I got stress, anxiety and depression. I'll say, once my aunt told me \"Believe in what you can do, and not in what you can fail on\", she hasn't never give up on what she can achieve in her life. Failures comes one after one, and after one, that I told myself \"You are going to be okay, and you are going to do what you like and succeed and make your parents feel proud of you\". I started to think positive, and do the things right, nothing last forever, I got rid of my depression but still with stress and anxiety, but from there to now it doesn't mean nothing for me.

Failures come as a good parts of success to set it down and success in life.. Some people fails in their path because they dont understand the meaning of the failures.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree with the idea that Success consist of going from failure to failure, even if you loss your hopes or enthusiasm you got to keep going in your goal to succeed.\n\nMore than 50% of people, I will guess, fight for their future they put all their effort to succeed and if they can, we can. For example I'm from Generic_City and all my family are Hispanic and our home language is Spanish, and speaking English its not easy for me, but I never thought that I was going to be able to speak it. There will be more than failures, there will be big obstacles and some times people will put traps in your path.\n\nSome people will just want to see you fail in the field and some will be happy to see you in the top of the mountain. I was failing in school and I felt so sick that I was giving up so easy and fast",

By understanding the mistakes made and reflecting on how to do better in the future, we can build up our resilience and prepare for future challenges. \nFailure is an important yet often uncomfortable part of life. Successful results can come from being diligent and methodical in any endeavor.. It is important to strive for success on the path up to it, as well as learn the lessons from mistakes along the way. \n\nFor instance, a student who has failed a test may take time to analyze the mistakes they made and use this to focus their future efforts. It can cause a decrease of hope, enthusiasm and faith and make people feel like their efforts are futile. This forward-thinking can help the student develop the persistence and determination to succeed. However, failure can also be used to motivate people to succeed",

The Benefits of Having A Good Attitude.\n\nIt has been said that a positive attitude is the key to success in life.

There is evidence that hard work, resilience, and talent are all equally important to attaining success. Positive thinking makes it easier to view a problem as a challenge, instead of an obstacle. Moreover, research has shown that having a positive attitude can make it easier to focus on tasks and circumvent negative emotions. With a positive attitude we can reach our potential and achieve our ambitions.. \n\nDespite these advantages, there is a debate about whether having a positive attitude is necessary for success.

If you do not try nothing new and do not applied on your daily, do no expect to become successful as a person. The process of being a mother for the first time, does not end when you give birth to the baby. Any subject that you have learn is to help you find what you really like and how you can used for the future. Do not stay in one point and make sure to keep walking and doing new stuff to help you grow, do something new everyday and prove yourself that you have become a successful person every time you go a step ahead. There is not a book where it details you how to take care of your child, even if there is one it would probably not be as helpful as you learning each day.\n\nIf there were a class of \"How to be a mother for the first time if you are a teen\" it would not cover all the expectations that you baby requires because you will be the only one that knows your baby, its behavior and what its needs are. The fact the it seems that you have got far enough where you might feel afraid to go beyond, which could ruin what you already have does not mean it will. After you have got the extra years, does not mean your learning have also stop, when you get to practice for the career you have selected you keep developing your skills and growing as a person, and this because of the motivation of keep going beyond of what you already manage.\n\nGoing beyond your expectations as a person would bring you benefit to your life. The answer is yes, even if you have been in school for about 10 years and still have to go to college to get you the information that you need to be able to get a decent job, yes it is necessary. Like is being remarked again the importance of keep learning to do new things so you can grow.\n\nThe importance of always going forward and learn to manage new things will make you grow as a person in your life and improve the labor work. Teen mothers learn through the pregnancy to; take care of the baby, change diapers, give appropriate food and how give them bath. You have experienced the process to gather the sufficient information to get this job, but now you are being told to go beyond and now you need to learn the system of the factory, office, building, hospital or any apartment you have being positioned. Keep growing to encourage yourself and others to keep doing something new and always going in different direction without stopping.. If you feel like that was enough and you got to were you stay, it is because you can go more fatter with the experience that you have. People argue that they are scared to keep going forward and decide to just stay stand where they are because is been far enough. If you have been studying for years, since first grade and still have to go to an University, it could make you think if it would be necessary those extra years. That is why there are those extra years for college, to start to focus on your objective and teach you what you actually need to become successful. Like always and how the Author Ralph Emerson emphasizes you would have to keep trying new material. The main piece to improve your skills is during the process of keep learning. I strongly agree with the words that Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, people that have got the title of professional and keep being successful in their daily are the ones that are still adding productive information to their life and career. The years where you have been taking classes that does not look that t would help you in the future in any way. Even adult mothers have said that they keep learning how to be mother everyday.\n\nDo not push back yourself because of the fact that you seen to be far away from your objective. The actual key that makes people become professionals everyday and give them the recognition of master is through the process of keep learning new things.\n\nConvince yourself that yo are not good enough \"Yet\" this to motivate you to believe that you need to learn more. If you get a job based on your skills, experiences or knowledge it would also require the same process of keep learning. The most common mistake that someone can make is believe that they have learn enough to the point where is nothing else to learn. If you got the job where you always wanted and they approved you to work there because you qualify and you have study the career for years does not specific mean you know everything and you would directly get to the work and lead yourself to become another worker. Examples that we can see everyday, teen mothers when a young girl or even in some cases girls that are still considering a kid have to been each to be a mother. You are the only one that knows how to lead yourself and what weakness and strengths you have, as a captain of your life you know where your boat should go, the wind could make you take different directions which is why you have to recognize where exactly your destination is. Most of the people got to the point where they become successful, thinking that they have the sufficient knowledge to stay where they are and not move forward. In this case does not mandatory need to keep educating yourself, but to improve in your work and become an efficient person you need to keep learning new skill that would apply to your job. You should not let yourself be the obstacle to keep learning new things to do",

By engaging in learning activities, individuals not only prevent stagnation, but also open themselves to a variety of opportunities that can lead to personal growth and success.. Ralph Waldo Emerson emphasized the significance of this by noting, \u201cLife is a journey, not a destination.\u201d His message is that knowledge is obtained through the journey of life, and only through continual learning can one reach their goals. \n\nThis concept is evident in everyday life. For example, individuals from all walks of life may take a class to learn a new skill, such as a coding language or baking. Studies have found that the more time individuals spend with their studies, the more likely they are to discover talents and interests they were previously unaware of. By engaging in such activities, people are able to gain knowledge while also expanding their interests and gaining insight into what they enjoy.\n\nEducation is key when it comes to discovering new passions. \nIn today's world, it is of paramount importance to continue to learn new skills and information, both for success and personal growth",

Everyone goes threw a situation that they probebly think they hate themself and wanna change the person they are, but I think that is wrong and they should be thereselfs and understand that everything will be alright at the end without them trying to change themselfs.\n\nIn my opinion I do not think that changing yourself will help with anything and I think it would probebly make things worst. People will go through tough times but it does not mean you should automatically change yourself for that. LIke for an example if you change yourself nothing is gonna happend just you letting yourself down and changing who you are that should not have been in that situation. It is okay to have mistakes because everyone learns from them and next thing they will do better then the last time they did something bad or had a mistake. I don't agree with the fact that people have the courage to change for others, because in any case they should just be thereselfs and love them for who they are, is the greatest accomplishment and feeling ever.\n\nIt is the greatest accomplishment because of the feeling that you loved yourself and secceeded without someone bringing you down and making you change yourself is the best feeling to feel. . Also people would most likely notice and ask why you change yourself and that would bring back memories and make you go back in time and see why you change yourself. But if you dont change yourslef no one would know and wont bring up any badly past back memories. People would most likely be so positive if they would be themself and not changing constantly or ever themselfs for people who are ignorent. There are so many reasons why I agree with this statement especially in today's society that most people in this world are changging themselfs for someone else. It is such an amazing feeling and more people in this world would be great if they would'nt change for someone else because they would get the confidence and not worrying about what others has to say about them. People who love you would never say to change the person you are because that is just wrong and they know that they would not want to lose you as the person you are. But if you can secceed people will leave you alone, because they know you will not listen to the rude comments you would recive and there just wasting there time. Otherwise the people who are trying to bring you down are winning and you are giving them the power that they should not have. So in all saying that everyone should not change and be themselfs in a world that is constantly trying to change them. Do you think the greatest accomplishment in the world is to be yourself in a world that is trying to change the person you are?, because I do not think people should change themself ever for what god brought us in the world for who we are and not changing ourself for others. So then you have the power and accomplished the negetivity that people are trying to change yourself.\n\nAlso being yourself does not mean you wont have mistakes because everyone does and that is okay just without you changging yourself and accomplishing thing is the best part of life. So yes, I agree with Emerson statement about individuality, because people in this world are trying to change themselfs for others or just changing themselfs because they dont like themselfs for who they are. Also mistakes can happend and if you change yourself and go back and see old pictuers of you of how you used to be you might not like for who you are now and you cant go back because you change yourself for someone you did not want to be I mean you could always try but why try after you did it and cant go back.\n\nSo just be you and do not change for others who are constantly trying to make you something else who it is'nt you",

It may give them the confidence to follow the path of self-acceptance and discovery.\n\nAt the end of the day, though being oneself in a world constantly trying to change the person you are can be a daunting task, it is a great accomplishment that should be celebrated. To be true to oneself in a world that is trying to change you is a major accomplishment.\n\nIt takes courage and conviction to stay true to oneself in the face of opposition.

It is about understanding who you are, and accepting it, even if that means going against the common norm. Doing so shows that not only have you accepted yourself, but that you are capable of standing up for something you believe in. Being able to stand up for one\u2019s beliefs, no matter how unpopular they may be, is a key part of being oneself.

We learn enough in every class, and we learn everthing that we need to learn in that hour and a half. We will also be getting home late. Kids will be tired the next day because they wont get home until the evening. They should also have some fun during the school day they shouldn't just sit there and high school and middle school at least get to move around while they are switching classes. They all need to rest good so that they can be wide awake. What do you think should we add one and a half hour to our school day?         . They need to spend time with their family it is important to spend time with them. I think seven hours is enough time for a school day and to learn all the materials that we nned to know. Do you think we should extend our school day? No, I think we shouldn't extend the time because we already get enough learning and our classes are long. If they get home around eight then they will get to spend very little time with them. If we we extend the time then we could be very exhausted during the school day. This could also be very difficult for the bus drivers because they will be getting home extremely late and it will be dark when they are driving the kids home back from school.\n\nWe get enough time in school already so there is no need to add more time the the school day. They will get home late and they can't do much because they will have to focus on homework and school.\n\nExtending the time could be harder for bus drivers. They have to go to sleep early because they need to wake up on time. We learn what we have to learn and if we add time the the teachers won't really know what to do. They will be tired because they don't get enough sleep and they have to wake up very early. It would be very broing for them, because they don't get to switch classes like middle and highschool.

High school kids wake up around 5:00am and they will be at school for eight hours and then they wiil go home and do their homework. They also won't get to see their family as much anymore and spend time with them. They wont pay attention to class because they didn't get enough sleep and they will not be paying close attention to what the teacher is saying because the class it too long. They won't be able to do many activities after school because they are getting home late. If they don't get enough sleep this could lead to crashes. Sleep is the most important and you should get at least eight hours of sleep, and that can't be possible for bus drivers because they will get home late. I also don't think we should extend the time because we will be getting out of school later. Elementray students would be getting out out around 5:00pm and around that time it will start to get dark and it isn't good for bus drivers, because they cant see if they are somewhere very dark. Crashes aren't good because the parents can sue the county and that will be the countys fault because it was dark outside and maybe the bus driver couldn't really see outside.\n\nI dissagree with adding one and a half hour to the school day. I think we understand that they are saying and we understand the concept they are teaching us. When they get home they will have to eat, shower, and go to sleep because they have school the next day and they deserve some fun. They also can't do activities because of the homework they have and how early they have to wake up and the time they get out of school. The school day would be way longer for elementrary kids. They really can't do anything after school is done.\n\nIf we extend the time in school we will be at school later",

There are better ways to improve education that don't rely on cutting into the precious time students have for other activities.. Finally, for teachers, it would mean longer days with more lesson plans to create and teach. \n\nIn my opinion, extending the school day by one and a half hours is a bad idea. The additional time would place an undue burden on students, drivers, and teachers. \n\nAll in all, I think that extending the school day is not a good idea. For drivers, it would mean more kids on the road during rush hour, potentially leading to dangerous situations and delays. For students, the extra time spent in the classroom would leave less time for homework, activities, and family time; all of which contribute to physical and mental health",

Parents and educators often praise this sort of creative thinking, as it allows the child to take risks free from the anxiety of being wrong. \n\nIn conclusion, imagination is considered more important than knowledge because it is far more versatile, powerful, and adaptive.

A lot of people learn from their own failures in the past for doing something that wasn't easy for their own lives. And it's better to make mistakes for something greater later in life.

This quote spoke to me directly and showed me that failure was just a necessary step in the journey to success. On one hand, Churchill's quote highlights the fact that success, while valuable, is not static and there is always more to be done. On the other hand, Churchill's quote isn't complete without addressing failure. No matter how difficult the journey becomes, the courage and determination to continue will allow one to eventually reach their goals.. To achieve success one must not be discouraged by failure, but to use it as a learning experience and keep going with determination and courage. However, I used Churchill's words as a source of hope and motivation; regardless of my failures, I had the courage to push on and eventually graduate with much success. \n\nI relate to this quote personally; when I was in graduate school, I struggled to keep up with my classes and often felt adrift",

Maybe they already tried it, but they could not do it , that is why they believe that i could not do it either but not all time is the same, the world change every day so i need to try to show them that what they said it, it was wrong. Thus i something else is the greatest accomplishment. if . But if i like to be teacher do not matter what i earn. But one day he asked me what school am i going? i said Generic_School, can i go with you? he asked me, of course i said. They will trying to make me confuse.

I am agree with Emerson's statement about individuality because i can demostrate that they said is wrong, to show them what is defference between to make and to talk, and to be concetrate. I will tell them that i want to be something else in a world. And they tell me to be a teacher is not important because their payment is trash, they just can earn $1000 each months.

We also have notifications on our devices to notify us on when we've missed an important assignment or other things.\n\nThe real issue is whether the students are actually taking advantage of it's dependability to actually improve their classroom performance. The mind can perform differently when extensively staring into a phone screen and causes a lot of distractions in the classroom setting depending on how it's used. It is very easy to get distracted by other uses of the phone while also very easy to take answers from maybe a friend or find cheat sheets online. Modern education now requires plenty of technology to keep us updated, and there will eventually be a day where education is fully integrated into computers and touch screen devices.\n\nI do agree we need some form of policy or agenda to make use of the phone to help our student's with how they're approaching their education. Phone's are evolving rapidly and manufacturers are finding new ways of making them more useful for work, school, and social media. All it takes is serious debate and rationality for both sides of a subject matter to be comfortable and conclude with what helps us most while also advancing our students properly.. It is a unique creation we have come to experience in our time, and I hope our generation can think heavily on this matter with a progressive and open mind. The human brain can be effected on how long you use the phone regardless of where you are, and that issue goes across all devices. This is where a teenager's habit of text, calling, or sending pictures, brings up the debate of using cellphones for educational purposes. We don't have the right to control how people use their phone and that's where my opinion on it leans towards restriction policies and or, giving full responsibility to the teacher about when they can use their phone.\n\nOur phones are also effectively useful for keeping a calendar and keeping us notified of the important things in life especially in the educational sense where paper and memory just don't suit us very well anymore in this day and age. When having used your phone maybe in the middle of the night before a major test, your sleep is cut by maybe an hour due to the eyes being exposed to blue light shifts, which is the brightness of the phone seeping into your eyes, so it is very critical on how the person uses the device before, during, and after school.\n\nNow another big issue is having the freedom and functionality to use the phone however you'd like. As for educational purposes, using a cellphone to probably schedule some test dates, or save notes for later use can really improve keeping track of class subjects and assignments, considering most individuals carry their cellular devices on them every time of the day",

In order to make the use of cell phones more effective in the classroom, it is recommended that schools set clear boundaries and rules to limit the amount of time students spend on their cell phones during class time. Other potential solutions include providing students with learning apps and programs to use on their cell phones that are related to the subject they are learning in class, as well as giving students more incentive to stay off their phones and focus on their studies.. \nRecent studies have shown that the use of cell phones in the classroom can have a negative effect on academic performance and student engagement",

We are all failures but if we work hard we will become a better failure, A failure that succeed in life not a failure who just gives up and loses its enthusiasim. Trying hard and keep tryin till you reach success helps us to keep our enthusiasim.\n\nBeing successful in school well help us in our daily life. But always working hard and with alot of enthusiasim will help us succeed and acomplish many things such as getting a higher payment and getting a better employment can be possible if we always work hard towards success and with enthusiasim. Others well succed too since your transmitting the good vibe/ enthusiasim to them they will be inspired by you.\n\nPlaying a sport is not easy. I agree with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill when he said that \"success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm\"",
      "ai_text": "\nWhen it comes to achieving success in life, school, work and sports, there is an old adage that you can go from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. Moreover, enthusiasm is contagious. \n\nEnthusiasm is often overlooked as a vital ingredient to our success, but it can be a powerful motivator. This means that it is possible to be resilient to failure and to continuously persist in the pursuit of our goals. If we can tap into this positivity and spread it to those around us, we can help to inspire and motivate them to do the same. It can give us the hope and courage to continue on our journey, despite the hardships and setbacks that we may face. \n\nBy never allowing ourselves to be discouraged by failure and instead projecting enthusiasm and optimism, we can find the strength and motivation to keep pressing forward on our path to success.",
      "instructions": "Task: Investigate the idea that one can go from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm in order to achieve success in life, school, work and sports. Analyze how enthusiasm keeps us motivated to work towards our goals and how transmitting the good vibes to others around us can inspire them to do the same."

This is saying that people should believe in their self more than what other people say about them that will drag them down. True self-esteem dose come from praising someone to keep going and to follow their dream. People end up giving up and saying in their head I lost there is no way to catch up because Im all ready in last place. To when having to play in a sport people will want to win and not quit. This shows that courage can praise someone to keep going.\n\nFinally, many young teens should trust what adults say to them and not ignore them. For example, I was not confident on passing the SOL and my teacher was praising me to be positive and not to over think it. This show that when someone praises another person that they will have confidants in their self.\n\nSecond, courage can be helpful in over coming fears that can drag one self down. Also to listen to people that are there for others no matter what. Then it came to the SOL, and when I finished it, the next day my teacher told me that I had passed. For example, when I was younger I steal from stores with a couple of friends. For example, when running a relay race and you start to fall behind. People need to have thick skin to block all the negative haters and disbelievers because having courage, confident, and trust can help with self-esteem.\n\nFirst, people need to be confident in their self in order to fallow what they want to achieve in life. My mother told me not to hang out with other teens that will cause trouble. Like a good friend once said \"never let anyone put you down always get right back up on your feet\". Which I didnt listen to her and we got caught by the workers and they called our parents to come pay for the belongings we stole. This shows that by praise from adults, teens will make good choices that wont get them punished.\n\nIn conclusion, praises can be very helpful for a person to feel good about their self. This shows that having courage, confident, and trust can help with self-esteem.. However, some may say that teens can do what ever they want, they are wrong because teens need to be taught life lessons. She later then told me that I should believe in my self more. From the courage that is given to them then they will keep running till the finish line",

Trust in oneself and others can also help to build self-esteem, bolstering confidence and resilience. Studies have shown that we are more likely to reach goals and feel secure when we receive positive affirmations from those around us. It also shows that there are people around who believe in them and trust their potential. \nSelf-esteem is the foundation for feelings of self-worth and courage, and can be cultivated from positive affirmations provided by others.

In other word, it will affect them not knowing how hard it's to work hard for something they never force them self to do. Althought this might be valid,There is several ideas to considered such as, Students would not be able to experience of being part of a club or sport in school. Some school offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Also, In the furure sometimes they will be required to work with a group of people but they will not be comfortable because they never had that experience. Students would not know all the resposabilities it takes to wake up every single day in the morning to go to school and do all the work that is required to do to be able to graduate. First, Students will be isolated in their home all the time. As teen mature, they make opinions about issues that can affect them. In conclusion, teenagers should get the experience and the hard work it take to be successful in life at a young age.\n\nWhile some people believe that students should not be benefit to attend classes from home, others argue that students should be benefit to attend classes from home because they can do their work on their own pace. Students will not know how it feel to be part of a team or how to work as a team. For example, when they grow up they will not have the knowledge and the resposability it take to get a job out side of home.

Without face-to-face communication, many important learning and life skills such as team work, public speaking, and interpersonal communication are lost. Also, there is comparatively a lack of responsibility and guidance for progress when in an online setting.\n\nOverall, the future of distance learning for students remains, at the very least, uncertain. It is important that students are given the option to choose between the two learning methods in order to create an ideal learning environment.. This can provide a more engaging learning experience compared to traditional classrooms, as students are in charge of their own learning pace and environment. Equally, traditional classrooms are still preferred by some for a number of reasons, such as social connection and assessment feedback. \n\nHowever, students attending classes from home can suffer from issues concerning socialization, responsibility, and experience. For those who struggle to learn in a traditional setting, distance learning can provide a great alternative. \nRecent studies on the effects of distance learning on students' learning outcomes have shown both pros and cons",

For instance, in India, the government launched a program to provide free laptops and internet access to economically disadvantaged students, which has resulted in a reduction in poverty in the region. In this way, education can be a powerful tool for reducing poverty and promoting economic development..

In Tanzania, a program to train teachers in the use of technology has enabled students to access online courses and educational resources that otherwise would not have been available.\n\nIn order to make higher education more accessible, governments and other organizations need to create policies and programs that focus on reducing the financial barriers that prevent individuals from attending college. \nEducation has a profound impact on both individual economic and social outcomes and global economic and social conditions.

Most of high school teenagers stress and worry about colleges if they got in or not. In the majority of middle schoolers and high schoolers there is always stress and preoccupations about grades. School sometimes can be exhausting because some people could be depressed or stressed out to get their things done. Sometimes teeagers and adults carry many preoccupations that they shouldn't worry about but they have to if it envolves them. Schools should be the same, they could have more time to do their homework and rest, because there is stress in children. I I agree because people should have more time to rest mostly because the effect of the stress and the health of their body. And by taking the four-day weekend we are reserving energy and resources, by not driving cars or motorcycles because of the toxic smoke a vehicle throws to the air we breath.\n\nSometimes some of the big businesses become of abusive or people's hours to get extra work done. It should be people's decision if they want to stay extra hours if they want to get their work done. Schools should be the same and not be so stressful, it could be dangerous to stress and not sleep because they worry about the responsabilities that have to be done.. Everyone can run out of energy especially when everybody expects for you to do good. People work to live and not live to work they somehow got to look for ways to provide themselves and sometimes their families. By being worried too much can even cause you to go to the hospital so it would be not be good for your health. When you think about the things you have to do to support yourself you have to put yourmind to it and not slack if you want that advantage of thedays you are going to have work.\n\nIn conclusions I agree because people should have more time to relax and not stressed about their jobs and what they have to do. If they were to finish their jobs with everything done , they get to go home and be with their families.\n\nHaving the time off can be people to catch with work if they are behind or for teenagers to catch up with homeworks. People get exhausted and start to worry about all of their responsabilities they have to do. Every single member of your family is always telling you to do good just to get things in life is very stressful. Working hard through four days it is more then enough to get work done if you put your mind to it.\n\nPeople need the extra time to relax, because it is not good for the body mentally and physically.

For one, having an extended weekend can help to reduce stress levels from the daily pressures of work and life.

Who wouldnt like a big vacation? good for some teachers that save money to enjoy summer.\n\nI also take the student position and as student I identified my self with the first character I describe when Students need the vacation to relax, but theres another big example of why vacation should be longer. I think that summer is to enjoy the weather, family, friends and if you have a pet also him and everything else.\n\nno body would like to be thinking about school work or trying to figure it out to complete homework.\n\nIn my opinion students need to relax from a big long year of school and this is not just convinient for for young people, we also know that we have a clear example of Adult people( older people)\n\nthey also need a big break from their jobs because they might feel really tired or stressed with work same as students and so that i am not trying to compare adults with young people I know they have even more responsabilities with their lifes but students comes to be more understanble because of the reason that they need to save more energy and have enough sleeping time but adults also need the same things and due that many jobs required just a week of vacation (sometimes even more) they feel really streess and tired and that why they would really wish to have a big vacation to can spend time with their family etc. first of all some student plan their goals during the summer probably to get a full time job during summer ( i KNOW EVEN SOME TEACHERS do )\n\nto can save money and spend it on things they need another example is to save money for collegue, yes for collegue.\n\nand probably this is the major goal of many students trying to have a great summer because of the only reasong that they dont have as much support as the other students but at the same time I understand teacher or educators because their goal is to push us up in our goals and the once a year a 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week of in spring and fall sounds really nice since some student may love the weather by those times even though they like to see the fall so theres not problem concluding with everything else it will be almost the same as the regular summe vacation except that It will be more shorter.\n\nIn conclusion, the break that we already have is perfect because of the only reason of that many student love it, the weather is so chill the beaches are already open and is enough time to go out of town to see your family and have a great time with them and good for those who liked to work during summer just to have some extra money or help a little of bet their spences.. same with student now that they have the opportunity to have a big vacation enjoy it.\n\nPlus many students really love summer because the weather( the warm breeze) the feeling of summer or the feeling that you know like freedoom not worry about your grades, activities, projects and etc",

Spring and fall breaks provide a nice balance between the short summer break and the longer winter break, giving students a week to rest and reset midway through the academic year. A 3-4 week break in the summer offers students time to relax and recharge, but it can also put them behind in their academic studies when school re-starts. This helps them to prepare for the future, as well as establish a sense of responsibility and independence. \nAccording to research, students typically receive far more break time throughout the school year than non-student adults. This can in turn have a significant impact on their long-term success and the skills they gain over summer breaks can help to make them even more attractive to future employers.. \n\nStudents who use the summer break to their advantage can set goals such as gaining professional experience by securing a full-time job or saving money for college",

      "human_text": "Energy is one of the most expensive resources,we pay for electricity,because to reproduce energy it goes through an expensive process.\n\nThe prompt says that adopt a four days of work with each day consisting of ten hours it is going to conserve more energy. I believe the change is going to be stressful for many parents who both of them need to work. An example of sunlight energy can be the calculators that need to be charged with light,so they do not need batteries which is a good one.\n\nThe government and obviously every single person need take care of this amazing resource to conserve it for a long time. Conserve and earn energy is a big challenge for all,we thought that little things like leave the lights turn on for along time and do not use them is a loose of energy and money,those little things affect us believe it or not and of course affects our aconomy. I think ten hours of school is not going to make a big difference,first of all that change will create many conflicts with students who practice a sport,have things to do after school,or need to work after school the time is not going to adjust.\n\nParents will get in troubles to pick their children or to leave them in an extracurricular activities,even if the school adopt that proposal that does not mean that all of the jobs and schools are also going to adopt it,so that is going to affect families who have children in that school. I thing that can help us to reduce the lost of energy,but at the end we make the change. We usually go to school an average of seven hours,if the businessses want to add two or three more hours to be in total ten hours taking out one day,and becoming just four days of school each day ten hours of work,In my opinion is going to be the same,because the two or three extra hours that they would add is the same that one more day of school;however,what is going to happen with the students that are in sports,have other activities or students that are in clubs,they will going home till night,I believe that is not good for anybody,they are not going to have time to do their homework for the next day,or an extra activity if they want during the rest of the day.\n\nIn conclusion let the things stay same till this day,we can conserve energy doing other type of proposal that not affect too much the people and their activities. In fact,all in the world has advantages and disadvantages as I mentioned.\n\nOne of the advantages that I can see is that teenagers are going to be more hours doing good things being in the school,and not waisting their time doing things that are disturbing for them. One example can be when people who need a babysitter to take care of their children,we know that person also have a family or have things to do after job and if her job take more time that she usually do is going to affect her. All of those resources complement each other to do their functions for example: without water we would not have energy,water helps to make energy when it is coming down like a waterfall,so there is when water produce energy. We used to have two days out of school,but now we are going to have three,so if we add the days like early dismissal,vacations,or because of the weather those are going to be lost days,in fact we are going to lost more days,so I think that is going to affect our academic life. The good thing is that we are going to have one more day off out of school. The period of time that we used to have to finish the unity for each class sometimes does not adjust and we get busy,imagine if we just have four days of school plus the teens that like to be absent. We are teens,we just want to have a good adolescense. Those are my thoughts,so we can help our world being more educated with our enviroment and the resources that they provide for us. We also know the sun is an energy reproducer and we can get a natural energy,the type of machine that is used for that kind of energy is a little expensive,but is better than a normal energy that we use every single day, it is less dangerous for our enviroment. We can start doing little things like turning off the lights of our house when we do not stay there,or when we do not use them. Not all of the people are able or agree to work till late,and if they accept they want to be paid more.\n\nHaving a long days of school,I mean more hours that we used to do can be stressful for students that are very mischievous or rude,they just want to go home early as they can and if the school add more hours they are going to be more rude than they are. Energy is something indispensable in our life,so if we do not take care of that resource we are going to have a lot of problems in the future,as energy become more expensive or something like that. Energy and many different resources are a big patrimony that nature gave us,every single person need to take care of every single resource that we have like energy,water,etc. We can provide huge things to our country and the world if we want.",
      "ai_text": "Furthermore, the extended weekend could allow for good recreational activities and potentially more time spent with family.\n\nOn the flipside, the downside to a four-day, ten-hour school week may be that students will be required to attend school for a much longer period of time each day than usual. It is important for administrators to keep in mind that an effective school day should provide students with a balance of academic and extracurricular activities, and should ensure that their physical and mental health are both taken into account.. This could encourage them to better manage their time, become more organized, and complete tasks more efficiently. Additionally, it could cause them to lose valuable time with friends and affect their social development.\n\nUltimately, the decision to adopt or reject a four-day, ten-hour school schedule should only be made after careful consideration of both its potential benefits and drawbacks. This could lead to feelings of exhaustion and could be particularly difficult for younger students who are already more susceptible to tiredness. Proponents of this idea argue that it could provide students with more breaks and lighter homework loads, as well as giving them more time to explore and pursue activities beyond the classroom. On the other hand, opponents of this concept worry that it could cause kids to experience fatigue and lack of focus due to the length of each day.\n\nIn terms of advantages, there is the potential for improved student productivity due to the shorter but longer school days. \nThe debate over the potential pros and cons of switching to a four-day, ten-hour school week has been raging for some time",

However, many people are cheating to get the their goal so easily. So, it's not a shame that you are failing at something; but, it's a more worst that you lie to people and start falling down.\n\nAlso, setting our aim low will help us achieve the goal because many people are working-hard to get what they want.

It helps me counting the money faster and also it helps me improve my positives toward the other people.\n\nMany people disagreed that setting our aim low won't help us to achieve our goal because sometime lying could be good for some reason and achieve the goal very easy.

On the positive side, curfews can lead to improved safety levels, as they restrict the number of hours that teens can be out and potentially engaging in risky activities. \nRecent studies have shown that the imposition of curfews can have both positive and negative effects on teenagers and their communities. Additionally, curfews can lead to improved morale within the community, as they can reduce levels of vandalism and youth delinquency. Furthermore, teens may express feelings of resentment or entrapment when curfews are imposed, which can lead to an erosion of general trust within a community. Ultimately, when considering the impact of curfews on teenagers and their communities, it is important to consider both the potential benefits and drawbacks of the policy.",

The key to success is always get advises from an expert or even your parents, which will make you a better person in life.\n\nSome say that, we as teenagers can make decisions on our own; but, they are wrong because not everyone can handle their own situations. As a teenager, we might think we know everything but it's the complete opposite. I felt relieved because I had so much pressure on me. The next day I woke up and realized what I had done wasn't right. After that, I apologized to my friend and everything went back to normal. However, I decided to talk to my parents and they gave me some good advises regardless to what I had done.

In this essay, I will argue that making decisions on your own can lead to some problems and you need someone's help. Seeking for help from someone else is always a better option.

And sports i do agree with the principal is for students can learn to do team work conumect with others and trying there best to win or at list not loss the game that's how they can learn and it shows the teacher how good there in one thing then the other\n\n.And students council i don't now what that is or what it means but i think if like to help keep the school or help janutors, teachers,or the principal with something. or take photographs of all the teachers of the school like put what they do or what they teach students. And for the student council students can just do what the student council dos because i have no idia what is or what it means .\n\nSo what I am trying to say is that yes some students hood stay after school to participate on one of this activitys the principal has probited for them i can help them on soemthing not like help them alot but just a little for the students know how it is to do something.. But in one thing some not all students some hood really stay after like the ones that can't speak english, or the ones who need help on writing on english,or the ones who really need help to read on english .\n\nOr the ones that want to learn more about a other laenguech they can just stay in the same class that they have the leangucj they want to learn about and just tell the teacher if they can stay after or not no if the teacher is gonna stay after for then they can stay after and learn more of the leanguch they are learning about.

And i disagree inone thing again some students just stay after school to finish a test,work,progetor a asy for the teacher or just stay to learn more about what there wanna do of the work or esy is wanna be about. The principal wants students tp join sports maybe because he want some students to get on shape or to atend some after school activitis for example like a dance club to see how students do and art club to see how students draw and students council. I also disagree because some students need to do some at home like help there father or a family member o something of life or have to work in a reasterunt to help there family with bills or other thing like that is why some don't have the time to do any of dos after school activitis and others,or have to take care of a sibiling or a family member and don't have the time to stat for after school activitis for the cause of dos thing that I just said.

They are wrong because the more further you go to accomplish things will make you grow more and it wil help you reach more goals in anything.\n\nAlways try to do more then what you have already done. you tried your hardest and did as much as you can to get to the top. You will defenetly grow if you keep trying. If you have accomplished somthing in life but you are not where you want to be then go for more. You will learn from your mistakes and lessions. If you work hard at a job and show people that you are good at it, it can get you a better jobs in the future.\n\nMoney dose not come to you for free you must do something for it for example, when i was 12 years old i was to young to get a job so i would go next door and ask if i can mow thier lawn or if they had any jods for me.\n\nWhen you are trying to reach a goal in life and you are growing big time more money gets involved, which is a really good thing.

All of us have good examples and they will tell why its a bad idea and they will disagree with you. Also sometimes when I don't stay afterschool, I take nap at home I wake up at eleven o'clock, I go to sleep at three o'clock. Also if you add more hours parents will take out their childern and they will put them in a different school. For example, like I said I stay afterschool on wendesday's and seven hours of school place the two more hours for afterschool. I usally stay afterschool for peer helpers every wenesdays. Also some people stay afterschool that palce two more hours of school. We got other things to do afterschool. If you add more hours, students will be picked up every last period and not even be there when the teacher is teaching. That what I think about you adding more hours to school. Some of as have good grades and some of as are trying our best. I hope you think about it and think about if your idea we are actally taking benfits.\n\nWhy I disagree with school board is wrong that you guys are adding more hours of school. That is nine hours of school. But I know where you guys are coming from you want us to have more education.\n\nI really hope you don't add more hours because seven hours is enough for us to learn. It gives me headace and our late bus is the last one to go, so basically I go home five o'clock and sometime when the late bus comes early I go home like 4:48pm. This why I want don't you guys to add more hours because it will effect our sleeps.. When I go home I eat and take a shower I watch for a little bit I say I'm take a nap it doesn't end up a nap it ends up I wake up at six o'clock. Also we will not have afterschool activity because students can't stay afterschool past six o'clock. Also we try our best as we could.\n\nAnother example that you can't add more hours to our school is that some students have sports afterschool not in school out of school. We have regular school days seven hours a day. But either way I love helping special kid's and also I will love to finish this year helping PROPER_NAME, even though I'm about to finish my community severs hours I will still help the kids.\n\nAnyways this about me disagreeing with school borad. What I'm really trying to say we wake up at six o'clock or five o'clock and we come to school and we do our work. I Disagree the school board is adding one and half hours each day of school. We recpect our teachers as much as we could, we do our work and we some how understand what the teacher gives us. Even though there is sports in my school they already sign up for other sports.

With an extra hour and a half added to the day, students would become fatigued easily, thus taking time away from learning that could potentially be used to delve deeper into the curriculum. \nThe school board's newly implemented decision to add one and a half hours to the school day would be detrimental to the overall physical and mental wellbeing of students.

Theres students who would rather focus on online classes and finish them and also have a part time job on the side to help them pay for their colleges.\n\nIn conclusion, distance learning is an advantage to students who are proactive and for students who learn better on their own. Having to do your school work online and especially at home makes it feel more comfortable. Students having the option to have distance learning would only be great for students who are responsible and cable of keeping up with their assignments. For example, I'm not the type of student that can sit in a classroom for 2 hours or more and listen to a teacher talk. Student can walk around anywhere with their computer or phone and simply pull up the school work and start doing it on their free time.\n\nSome students would say its better to come to school, meet people and have the high school experiences. Distance learning is beneficial to students because they won't have to worry about getting up early to go to school and also, don't have to worry about that amount of time they have in class to finish an assignment. Waking up at 9 to 10 is a good time to start your online classes because you had enough time to wake up shower , eat and that most important part is that you dont have worry about what clothes your going to wear to school.\n\nAnother reason that distance learning is beneficial to students is because as high school students is not really easy to keep up with a teacher. But, in high school your not allowed to randomly get up and walk around it would make the teacher feel unsafe or the students. The teacher is not going to explain the whole lesson to 1 student she would simply say check online for the assignment. Having to wake up in the morning and sit in a classroom for 2 hours is uncomfortable. There are some teachers are just not the type to go back and repeat their self. I would, prefer to move around and also eat while i'm doing my work that makes me feel more focus. when they're teaching a lesson with 28 more students in the classroom that probably already understood the assignments. Although it sounds fun. For example, When a student miss class it feels like you missed a whole quarter. Its also helping students get ready for the real world when they have to take home assignments from work and make sure to stay focus. Some kids don't show their full attention in school because they're not a morning person. Theres still students that would prefer being home and getting their work down at home then being in school dealing with drama or extra assignments. Taking online classes gives the student more freedom to expand their thinking while having their own space at home.\n\nA way that distance learning benefits students is not having to wake up at 6 or 7 am in the morning to go to school",
      "ai_text": "Distance learning also empowers students to customize their academic plans to fit their own interests and needs. In many ways, distance learning provides high school students with unprecedented access to educational opportunities.. For example, students interested in pursuing a specific academic pathway can access online courses or programs that focus on their desired topic of study. Students can attend virtual classes from the comfort of their own homes, cutting out the need for a long commute or relocation to another city or state. Through distance learning, students can gain access to quality educational programs from anywhere in the world. Additionally, because students attend virtual classes, they can access coursework on their own timetable. Allowing students to progress at their own pace can be especially beneficial for students with special needs or medical issues that may prevent them from attending in-person classes. \nDistance learning has become an increasingly popular educational option for high school students in recent years",

Second, I don't see why we shouldn't be able to bring them at all because say we forgot our homework at home and say we already missed a day of homework and if we miss another one we will get a detention, we can just call our mom during lunch break or passing period and tell her if she can bring our home work.

For example, when an emergency or urgent situation arises, teachers can easily contact students\u2019 parents or guardians using their cell phones. This sense of connectedness will likely provide students with a sense of comfort and security and can help to reduce any anxiety or stress levels that they may experience while at school.\n\nFrom a teacher\u2019s perspective, students having access to their cell phones can provide a number of benefits. Furthermore, students can use their cell phones to access other helpful tools such as calculators and translation services which will enable them to better understand and engage with their lessons. Through the use of educational applications and online research resources, cell phones can be used to broaden students\u2019 knowledge and supplement their school education. \nCell phones have become an essential part of modern life, and many students rely on them for communication, entertainment, and productivity. \n\nAdditionally, giving students access to their cell phones allows them to stay connected with their friends and family.

For instance, some students are being pressured by their parents into finding a career before they go to high school and that can lean them into having stress. Students might not know what they still want to do in the future since they're still young. This can later lead them into having a successful life if they start to study the careers the students want at a very young age. All of this can later lead to a state of mental, emotional strain, anxiety, or they start think they wont be successful in life. While this may be true, others argue that students should commit to a career at a young age. Students shouldn't have to worry about what career they want since they're still young and they can later end up to stress. For instance, when students start to study a career they want, they can end up having a very successful job in their future. Committing to a career can lead to causing mental or emotional stress.. For example, their courses of study in high school are selected to guide them toward a specific career in life so they can be successful. They should also try to focus on being just kids; then once they start to get older they can start to think what kind of career they want to do later in life.\n\nIn conclusion, i think students shouldn't commit to a career at a young age because of all the stress they might get they might not know what career they want in the future. The younger students in elementary school think they know what they already want to do for a career in the future, but once they get older and enter high school they start to change their minds about the career they choose as a kid. For example, students have trouble trying to identify a career they want in life. Students should not commit to a career at a young age.\n\nCommitting to a career at a young age can cause students to have stress.

In some cases, adjusting to their role may come at the cost of important aspects of childhood, such as engaging with friends and family, playing sports, and finding time for hobbies. Having to juggle multiple competing responsibilities can be mentally taxing, and lead to a sense of confusion and stress that can cause children and young adults to feel helpless in their career path.

Consider the example of someone who has been struggling with an addiction for many years. When a person is failing to learn from their mistakes, it is highly unlikely that they could adequately address a new problem using their best efforts.\n\nThough some may argue that facing a problem is beneficial, as it allows one to be proactive and seek assistance from the resources needed to solve the problem, this has the potential to come at a cost. For some individuals, the consequences of their current problems may be too great for them to handle. As such, it is not always easy for an individual to perform optimally when faced with a problem. This situation clearly demonstrates that simply labelling a problem as an opportunity to do one's best is not an effective solution.\n\nFurthermore, some individuals acquire a bad habit of repeating the same mistakes over and over again",
      "instructions": "Task: Write an essay that disagrees with the statement \"A problem is a chance for you to do your best\" while referencing examples of people who fail to learn from their mistakes, those whose problems have already affected them, and how the best way to succeed in life is by making fewer mistakes."

While some first impressions are accurate in predicting how people will behave, many times they are not, which is why it's so important to be aware of them. Sadly, these initial, often inaccurate, impressions would remain with me for some time. It's even been shown that first impressions are made primarily using visual cues such as clothing, hairstyles, body language, and facial expressions. They can shape the way we view the people, places, and cultures around us. Throughout my life, I have both experienced and seen first impressions that are hard to overcome. For example, I remember going to a new school and having my first impressions of the other students being based on what they wore, the things they said, and their general attitude towards the other students. It's also important to remember that first impressions are not always accurate, and making snap judgments about someone could lead to misdirected opinions and misunderstandings of the person in question",

One of the most funnest and amazing things the Avid activity has is we do fundraisers to raise money to go to King's Dominion and once your there you well be like I've earned this because for example your working hard and your not doing nothing fun like whats gonna make you keep doing that like even is you wanted to be someone in life your gonna work as hard as you can without looking down because you have something that's giving you the support and keeping you strong. College is something not everyone is looking forward to as a teenager but some of us are, but if we start hanging around with the bad types of people it can drag us to the deepest part of an ocean in other words theres no coming back up to where you use to be. Tutorials in other words shows your personality in a way when your not a shy person to go in front of your group and talk some people don't like that they like keeping them self in a inner circle talking less but listening to the tutorials.\n\nIn addition you get field trips which most middle schools or high schools students don't have that opportunity you get to visit colleges and learn about them it helps you know more about colleges and also having fun by walking around with a person guiding you to where you should go plus you get to meet knew people once your there. Lastly Its like saying you have another family no matter where you go.\n\nIn Avid you learn to become a responsible and hard working person in a way that you have a binder check every week to stay organized. In my point of view I'm working hard and something that encourages me to do better is my niece. Its like another class but in Avid we all have a dream that we all want to achieve in which we know we have to keep trying and there's no giving up in till we accomplish it. Also its like a family so if you have a family that doesnt really care about you Avid can cover that in a way you can be your self and you don't have to pretend to be anyone else. You get to do cool activities and join programs. Its just a big opportunity you get to be in it you should be a risk taker because once you are you never know it can lead you to a positive direction you can become a great person and become someone in life. The Avid activity is basically kinda the same you work hard doing tutorials and making coneal notes and at the end of the year you get to go and have fun with friends and ride roller coasters its just a really fun thing to do.\n\nAvid for me and any other students I think would agree Avid is a family we do something everyone agrees and everyone has fun with it to no one talks bad about anyone and even thought we all come from different places around the world no one is mean to one another we all stay together we all learn the something if one the Avid students want to give up we make sure they don't because we're a family and something we always say when we're down is ''dream, believe, achieve ''.                                                                                                   . In addition you also get the opportunity to go on beautiful fun field trips. An enjoyable educational activity is Avid for anyone that has a dream they want to achieve. The first reason why\n\nI say this is because this activity is not only to help you become a better person but also to encourage you to go to college . Secondly They give you tutorials not only to see where your at but to help you improve in any class . This activity helps you and school but also knowing your making your self proud but also you're parents and family .\n\nIn conclusion the reason why I think this activity is enjoyable is because your getting to meet knew people and you never know you would find you own best friend there. It's just a very cool opportunity you have to be able to do things not all students are allowed to do",

So, this opportunity offered by the schools to give this type of classes can motivate each student that live far to not excuse themselves to not finish a class, also, each school that do not have this classes should considered create them.     . There are some cases where a student just have one class every day; what if this student live half an hour away from the school, it would be way more easy if this student can take all his classes in two days online, also, this can be a great oportunity to have a job while you are studying.\n\nIn conclusion, the opportunity offered by the schools for the students who live far, to receive classes without going to the school by way of online or video conferencing is so great, beacuse the student can pay more attention being alone, if the student have questions the teacher can answer them easily, and the student do not have to waist time going to the school just for one class. Sometimes when you are in a classroom with more than 20 students is really hard focusing on what the teacher is talking about, because there are always some students who really like to make fun of the teacher, laugh with other students, interrupt the class with questions like \"can I use the restroom?\", and in someway you cannot even take notes; but when you are at home, all by yourself, without any distracction you can really be sure that you are paying atenttion and taking notes.\n\nSecond reason why I believe giving the oportunity to students that live far from the schools can take the classes by way of online or video conferencing is a great way to learn because if the student have questions the teacher can answer them easily. There is a debate about the opportunity offered by the schools for the students who live far, to receive classes without going to the school by way of online or video conferencing. For example, lets say that you are in a classroom with a bunch of students, each of them have differents questions about the class, and the teacher said that he is going to answer each question by alphabetical order, unfortunately, your las name is \"Generic_Name\". Some people believe that the best way to learn is going to the school independently if the student live close or far and participating with more students in the classes. I believe giving the opportunity to students that live far from the schools can take the classes by way of online or video conferencing is a great way to learn, because the student can pay more attention being alone, if the student have questions the teacher can answer them easily, and the student do not have to waist time going to the school just for one class.\n\nFirst reason why I believe giving the opportunity to students that live far from the schools can take the classes by way of online or video conferencing is a great way to learn because the student can pay more attention.

It is more important than knowledge because it enables us to find creative solutions to our problems, build upon our wins, and become wiser as a collective. Knowledge may guide us through life, but imagination can help us envision a better world. Without their vision, we wouldn\u2019t have access to lightning-fast communication and other tools that rely upon the power of imagination.\n\nImagination can also be credited with our ability to progress culturally and spiritually.

Another thing, is that knowing the consequences of your actions, could help another people; for example, if you are drinking you should know that you can not drive, if you do not drive another person will not die, because you know that you can have a car accident, and that is because people told you an example of what is going to happen if you drive while you are drunk.

They are going to tell you what is good and what is wrong; your parents influence you because they are your most important example, and that is what an example does, influence you, tells you what is good and what is wrong; for example, if your parents are good people, you should be a good person, but if your parents do not care about you, they do not listen to you or they treat people bad, you are going to be somebody who doesn;t listen to people, you will not care about anyone, so your parents are your most important example, because they have taught you what is good and what is wrong; and you can see again that the example influences you. It is going to make you know that people are telling this to you, because they don't want you to have bad consequences. Another example would be that when you are drinking, somebody would tell you don't think to drive, because my uncle died because he was drunk and he had a car accident,so you will know that people are advising you, because they know that you are doing something bad",

Lastly, student's knows what types of material they will need for the classes; to help them get prepare. It will keep them focuse on their goals and will make a big impact in their lives since they already have everything planed out. In my opinion young student's should start to think about their future career in a young age because it will give them an idea of what they want to be in their life and they will know what kind of courses or classes they will be taking to get to their goal. Also, If that happens, young student's get's lots of time to think of another career path they want to take. For example, kid's have lots of things they want to be so they get a head start so they can get an idea of what career they choices to take.\n\nMy last example is, They will know what kinds of courses or classes they will be taking to to get to their goal. In addition, This head start gives them time to plan and organize everything they need. In addition, This helps the student's a lot because they will already have the mind set to think of what they will be needing in the future. Lot's of people have responded to this question saying \"yes\" and \"no\". Sure , it's nice to go have some fun and get to enjoy life with the ones you care about more. Even though, some would argue that young student's shouldn't start to think about their future career in a young age because they will spend less time with friends and family.\n\nMy first example is, it will give them an idea of what they want to do in their life in the future. Also, they don't have to stress out about them taking the wrong classes. For example, a kid is thinking about being a police but then later on he wants to be a doctor, that give the kid time to think about what he wants to be. For example, young age student's can change their mind and might not want to choice that path no more. Everyone has their reason why they start in a young age and why they don't start in a young age. Like, If a kid want's to be a doctor when he grows up he will already choice the courses of being a doctor. In addition, this will prepare them for the real world. Also, they want to make precious time and memories with their friends and family. For example, student's can choice the right classes that will help them achieve their goal. Have you ever thought about staring your future career in a young age? Well, This question has been asked to a lot of people. So now, Do you think young student's should start their career in a young age?. However, you got to remember that you going to be the one responsible for your own future and if you put effort your going to have an amazing impact in the future with your career.\n\nIn conclusion, student's should start to think about their career in a young age because it will give them an idea of what they want to do in their life and they will know what kinds of courses or classes they will be taking to get to their goal. For example, kid's are so full of energy and want to go out and have some fun all the time. Like, that's a good skill to have, knowing what you need in the future and not worry about it in the last minute.\n\nSome would argue that student's shouldn't start to think about their career in a young age because they will spend less time with their friends and family",
      "ai_text": "Furthermore, since young students may not have experienced a breadth of different options, their decisions may be rooted more in a romanticized viewing of a potential job than in reality.\n\nIn summary, although there are benefits to young students starting to think about their future career, it is important to ensure that decisions made at such a young age do not limit the student\u2019s options and remain open to change and new possibilities.. Also, if students know of a career they would like to pursue, they are likely to be more engaged in planning for their future and have a heightened awareness of the value of their school experience in this regard. Decisions made at this time in life can too easily become rigid and inflexible. Deciding on a career path can be an important and empowering process, and there are several benefits to this. It can lead to more purposeful learning when young students are aware of the relevance of what they are learning in relation to their chosen career. \nAs students grow up they are encouraged to plan for their future, and this often starts with considering a career choice at a young age. \n\nOn the other hand, making decisions about their future at a young age can be overwhelming for students as they are not yet fully aware of the range of possibilities available to them",

For instance, it can limit our ability to have meaningful conversations, make us more prone to miscommunications, and make us more likely to become disconnected from people who don't use the same technology. Taking a day or even just an hour away from technology can encourage more meaningful conversations, strengthen relationships, and create lasting memories with the people who mean the most to us.

Although technology may help reduce physical distance between family, friends, and colleagues by allowing us to chat or video call, there is still a disconnect between personal conversations and digital communication",

For example, once I asked my friend if he could give me advice on what to study for the math test. He couldn't give me advice for the math test but he ended up giving me advice for the science test.\n\nYou always want to make sure you are getting the right advice and collaboration is a big key to finding if the advice, opinion or fact is correct. This method can also help you with a project. They took the boat apart and made hundreds of copies of it but they improved it by adding a plank so they can walk over to another boat and attack them.\n\nIf you are working on a project, a essay or just asking for advice always ask more than one person to make sure it's correct and the best. Asking more than one person will never harm you in any way. What it will do though is make you mare confident about what advice you are getting.\n\nSo, whenever you ask for advice, always ask more than one person.\n\nYou should ask more than one person for advice because you might find something that help you with another problem. If more than one opinion collaborates or says the same thing it's more likely to be true than the one that doesn't. Maybe you just don't understand what they are talking about but somebody else might restate the same sentence and that might help you understand it better. I know this because Rome and Islam used the same technique and that's what helped survive for so long. Whenever I ask for advice I always have one person that tell me something that's completely different but it always help me out later or with another problem. You know he is wrong.\n\nCollaboration is a good way to check if the information is correct but what if you don't understand the information or don't have enough to back it up. For example, when Rome was going to war with Carthage they didn't have a navy but they found boat from Carthage was up on shore. . More is better than one. That way you know for sure you are getting the right information. For example, when you're working on a project you want to go to more than one website to check if they have the same information. You might not find what you are looking for but it can help you in the future. If you ask multiple people for their opinion on something and five of them same give you the same thing but one person says something totally different",

Similarly, in the Islamic Empire, collaboration was seen as an important part of the decision-making process and ideas were welcomed from different stakeholders for input.\n\nCombining different ideas and perspectives when seeking advice or trying to solve a problem is a key advantage of collaboration. The multi-faceted approach, which included individuals with different expertise, allowed for all angles to be identified and addressed to ensure the end result was a project that was feasible and beneficial to the Empire. \n\nFor example, when creating a new infrastructure project within the Roman Empire, it was not uncommon for a variety of experts to be consulted. In both Empires, it was viewed as essential to truly understand the opinion and contributions of all parties involved in order to create a favorable outcome.. However, it is also important to understand the information and advice that is being provided before attempting to create a solution. By gathering input from multiple people, there is greater potential for a better solution to be identified and for the efficiency of the project to be improved. \nIn both the Roman and Islamic Empires, collaboration was highly valued as a way of pooling resources and perspectives to achieve common goals",

Using a tablet, laptop, or anything devices that has a camera can do video chat. Sttudents likes technology because they can research what they need for their project or homework.

I`m not saying that praising to much is a bad thing and i`m also not saying you should make the student hate what they`re doing. they get praised but thats not what drives them to do better its the hatred of what they do that gives the motivation to improve and even take criticism with a grain of salt but use it to get better. But i am saying that with every praise should be a criticism just to balance it out and show the students that with every positive comes a negative and that the worlds not just going to be all praise to a person.. They would improve but students also develop zero tolerance to any criticism and probably going to want all the attention focused at them.\n\nA great example to this would be any artist; artists are based all around the idea of everything they make are things that they'll hate even if theres true improvement. Using what we learned from any artist it`d be a terrible thing to do, as the purpose of a student is to learn and use what they learned in the world and in the world theres going to be people who criticize what they do and if they cant take that criticism they`re most likely gonna get fired.\n\nIn conclusion. Should a students work be praised no matter how bad it is? This sounds like a good idea in theory, but when you think of it only in the educational field is really a terrible thing to do.

I believe that if you are in bad mood and think that everthing is going to bother you is better for you to figured it out as soon as posible on you own, because people can not be involved with your own personal problem and i think even if you are not felling well you also need to be in a good attitude to the people because if you let you bad attitude to ruin the days of other they will think that you're always like that and will be enough to them to think the worse of you. By the way you cannot judge someone just for their apparience is like judging a book with out reading it, it can be someone who will look with an angry face, a sad face even it can look weird but if you dont start sharing time, knowing each other, know what they like and what they do or how they are you cannot put your bad attitude just for how they look, they can also treat you as the same you did to them\n\nHowever, people cannot recieve a bad attitude from you as if they were different to you. Even in your job is when you need to be the more kind as possible to keep those person that you don't know with you becuase as they need you, you also need them at the same time becuase they will help you to keep that job that you need, also your impression to them has to be best, as you show them at work you also need to show the best of you out of work that will show that you're successeful person in life and that you dont act good just when you need it and that is how you are and they can also trust in you because you are being honest to them.\n\nConsiderating that don't matter what you cannot give a bad treat to other person just because you woke up in a bad mood. Been in a poaitive attitude will appeal the attraction of other persons to you by that will hepl you to success. Because if someone is being rude to them and you act different and start helping them they will notice that you have a good attitude to others that you dont even know. I think that we all are same with some differences than others as religion, country, color, etc... I think that every person have the right to be respected not for what they have is just we all need respect. People cannot be treat it bad because of you mood or just because you didn't like how that person is. I believe that a possitive actitude has a good impression in othre persons. . The decison you make to be who you are is to realize that other person will act the same way to you as you just did to them.\n\nEveryone need to be respected don't matter the age, country or religion becuase we all are humans",

This could mean better relationships with friends and family, improved career opportunities, and increased respect from those around us. People will be more likely to help us out and return the favour when we treat them well. \n\nWhen we are in a bad mood or feeling stressed, it can be easy to forget about other people's feelings and take out our frustrations on them.

It's important to remember that respect and kindness go a long way, even when you don't feel like it. The attitude we have towards others can have both beneficial and negative outcomes, so it is best to be respectful and kind.. \n\nIn summary, treating people with respect, regardless of age, country, or religion, is essential for life success. \n\nWhen we show respect and consideration for those around us, it can lead to good outcomes",

One of my teachers told me, that she loves to read book in weekends, but she does not have time to read because she has a lot of work to do. . And this will help students and teachers to have more time to relax, to care about themselves, and to help others. Two days weekend will just be enough for students to spend time with their families and do their homework; it will not give them time for themselves. Some people think that three days weekend will make students forget what they learned during the week. Most of my friends love to exercise, but some of them gave up on exercising because they don't have time to do it. My school should follow this model by extending the school day two hours because teachers and students will have more time to relax,\n\nto grow and achieve more, and to help others.\n\nWe all need to relax, specially if we are a student because school is so stressful, and two days weekend will not give enough time to students to relax. But they are wrong teaching and learning are the most hardest things in the world.\n\nTo converse energy and resources, some businesses have adopted a four-day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours. My sister loves to volunteer and help other; she is volunteering once a month. But they are wrong because students will have more time to go over what they learned, and they have enough time to practice more.\n\nMost of the people loves to exercise, read, meditate, and swim in their free times. Last year during winter break, my math teacher told me that I have to try harder and study more, I told him that I can not understand the notes. My school should follow this model by extending the school day two hours. But they are wrong because longer weekend can help both students and teachers to care more about themselves by giving them free time.\n\nSome of the students love to help others, by volunteering. He said, \"I love to help students outside of school, but I don't have time to do it\". I personally rather to have more time during the weekend because I will have more time to finish everything that I wanted to do during the week, and I will have time to relax. Also, four days weekdays will teach students to work harder. my school should follow this model by extending the school day two hours. If we have longer weekends, teachers will be able to help more students. Also, in weekdays they can learn more, or teach more. Students can have more time with their families,\n\nto grow, and to work harder and achieve their goals. During the weekdays students can learn more and they will have more time in school to spend with their friends. If we give the students more time to study, they will get better grades. Furthermore, same for the teachers, they will be able to have more time with their families; and they can enjoy their lives with three days weekend. We met in the public library and he helped me to study. It be the best option for students because it will give them more time to experience, learn new information in a young age. Three days weekend will increase students chances to help others because they will have more time to do it. This model will be helpful for students, and teachers at same time. Some people think that students and teachers should not have longer weekend than usual because they have winter break, and spring break. Moreover, by two days weekend students can not relax and work for themselves. Furthermore, teachers are also the same, teachers need more time to spend with their families and kids, and they will be able to plan what are they going to do, or what they want to do with certain students who needs help. By giving them more time to relax. I think we have a lot of teachers like that, who wants to help students outside of school, but they don't have time. Some people think that schools should have two days weekend because they are not getting tired. She told me that she wants to increase it and do it more, but she can not because she has a lot of homework and she does not have time.

Second reason is that, this can be good also for those students that skip school everyday, maybe if they know that we just got four-day school week they would want to come to school. students that have to work start they shift at 5 pm and school would end at 6:04 pm, students would skip the last classes. First reason is that many students that have to work they would like to go to school beacuse of two more hours.

Second reason is that is going to be tired to be ten hours of school. This like the same think as five-day school week. First reason is that they can have one school-day off so they can go calm to the job. With this system we are not going to conserve energy and resources is going to be the same thing. Third reason is that two more hours of school are not a good idea for those that have a part-time, they would not be on time in their jobs. Third reason is that teachers can have more time to work on projects and do all that work that they have to do.\n\nSecond point of view is that is system can not be a good idea. First reason is that students would not learn as much as five-day school week. If my school follow this system can work for many students that have to work every day.

Students may find it difficult to adjust to an extended school day, teachers may feel overwhelmed by the longer teaching load, and the quality of education could be adversely impacted due to the lack of a traditional five-day week.\n\nFurther research into the effectiveness of the four-day school week is necessary in order to determine whether or not this system is a viable alternative to the traditional five-day school week. Conversely, in Arizona, the four-day school week had a significant negative impact on student performance and academic achievement.\n\nWhen compared to the traditional five-day school week, the four-day week appears to have both environmental and economic benefits; however, caution must be taken to ensure that the quality of education is not sacrificed. But what are the pros and cons of this new system? Research shows a potential for savings in energy and resources due to greater flexibility in managing the school calendar and the ability to reduce operational costs. But there are also potential drawbacks to consider. Several school systems have implemented this new system with both success and failure. \n\nThe four-day school week has grown in popularity as an alternative to the typical five day school week. For example, in the Wake County, North Carolina school system, students and staff reported greater job satisfaction and improved attendance.

Although some people disagree about Emerson's statement, actually I agree because society is always trying to make people change their point of view, their culture, their belivers. It's important to be proud of who you are because eventhough you make mistakes sometimes that doesn't have to make change who you are. First never give up, Second always love and be proud of yourself and Third don't forgot your roots.\n\nHere are some reasons why I agree with Emerson's statement. Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote,''to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment''. If you are from another country you are forced to change yourself, trying to pretend that you are someting else, but you must have to stop it. Third, don't forgot your roots. Because in a world that is constantly trying to make you be something else your biggest accomplisment is to show that you are better than what they expected you to be.\n\nFinally what are you waiting for!. Love yourself because every of your features, your character and your personality is what identify you, is make you unique, different from anyone else in the world that wants you to fit on it. Second, always love and be proud of yourself. Don't let the world change yourself, remember to never give up always fight for is better for you, love and be proud of yourself always and don't forgot your roots because every part of yourself is what make you unique, special and that is your greastest accomplisment.. Becuase it's important to continue being yourself, not matter if some people are not going to like it, the only one who have to feel comfortable with yourself it's you. You just have to learn from your mistakes, I know it is difficult but no one says that would be easy ,but you can do it",
      "ai_text": "Taking the time and effort to recognize and accept one's uniqueness, as well as focusing on one's own needs and goals, are two effective steps in achieving this greatest accomplishment.. Furthermore, by having an attainable plan to reach one's goals, one is less likely to be pulled away from achieving them.\n\nIn conclusion, it is clear that Ralph Waldo Emerson's statement, \"To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment\" is indeed true. It is essential to understand that everyone is different - no one is exactly like anyone else, and no single individual possesses all the necessary skills and qualities in one package. \nRalph Waldo Emerson's statement, \"To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment\" is a powerful idea that can be applied in myriad contexts. Instead, taking the time to set goals and develop long-term strategies to achieving them, regardless of external pressures and demands, is the most effective way to be oneself in a world that is trying to make you something else. \n\nThe next step is to devote time and energy to focusing on one's own needs and goals, rather than comparing oneself to others and attempting to constantly change oneself to keep up with their successes. Acknowledging and embracing this individuality can be both liberating and empowering. It speaks to the idea that being true to one's self is a valuable and underrated task. Comparison is a pathway to unhappiness, because it distracts one's focus away from oneself. Throughout life, there will be people and situations that try to change who you are, and there is great strength in resisting and staying true to oneself.\n\nThe first step to being oneself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is to recognize and accept one's own uniqueness",

Not to mention, these courses can often be more affordable than traditional classes. Finally, this type of learning can be isolating and lack the social aspects that come with traditional in-person learning. On the other hand, some may be apprehensive about this type of learning, as traditional schooling provides invaluable benefits such as personal interaction with teachers and classmates, individualized instruction, and consistent feedback. Additionally, many online courses are asynchronous, meaning students can access lectures and submit assignments on their own time. As such, it can be a great option for students looking to get a quality education while balancing other commitments and interests. What works best for each individual student will depend on a variety of factors such as budget, goals, and preferences. On the plus side, distance learning allows students to learn in their own environment where they can better control their schedule and other distractions. For one, there is no classroom setting, so teachers may be less available to answer questions face-to-face or have limited access to resources. \n\nFor those considering taking advantage of distance learning opportunities, I believe there are both pros and cons to consider. \n\nOn the other hand, there can be downsides to opting for distance learning. \nDistance learning has become increasingly popular in recent years with more and more schools offering online or virtual classes.

If people keeps being themselves in this world that just want them to be someone else, then they would find themselves where they've lost it and they would also find happiness. You do not try to please others. we think that we have to be someone else to please our society, which is not very true. They end up falling in an awful situation that may even risk their lives. No matter how good a person can look, having no confidence fade the beauty away. As they pleasing them, they end up making that person happy and automatically forget about their own happiness, which is not right. For example, some people might have abusive boyfriends/girlfriends who want them to do everything their way. Deep down inside they don't really want to, but they probably love that person and they have to do it if they want to please them. No confidence make people look weak and they don't believe much in themselves.

People are driven to become someone else in order to fit in with society, and often find themselves sacrificing their true identity in the process.\n\nThis need to conform can have dangerous repercussions. Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks, and Mahatma Gandhi are just a few famous figures who have courageously held onto their identities despite enormous pressure to conform to the status quo. As Ralph Waldo Emerson said, \u201cto be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.\u201d Remaining true to oneself, despite the obstacles thrown in our path, shows tremendous courage and resilience.\n\nThroughout history, there have been countless examples of people who have defied societal expectation to remain true to themselves. Pressure from the people around us can make it difficult to maintain our sense of self, especially if we feel like conforming to the expectations of the society is our only option.

Technology helps people to complete new task in every day life, and then we get use to taking help from technology instead of trying it our self or learning it we get a habit of letting technology do our work. Modern technology has negative impact on peoples life.\n\nPeople can check out books, shop, and play games without moving form place and talking to anyone. Technology at some point slow downs the physical growth or development of our body and it stops us from learning new things, But on the other hand it helps us to complete many task and save time. Technology helps us from not being delayed, it complete task 50% more faster than us, and helps us to save 25% of more time. For example, Our group got an assignment to do on Monday and the deadline to submit it was on Friday, So if i would read books to find some info, it would take me at least 2 weeks to complete that assignment, but thanks to modern technology,I was able to finish it in 3 days.\n\nAt last, I would like conclude that technology plays a major role in our day to day life. v or phone while taking lunch, 38% middle schoolers have glasses because of sitting in front of TV or using phone all the time, and more than 46% students are overweight or underweight as they don't do much physical activities.\n\nSecondly, technology stops us from learning new things. In fact, there was a survey taken few days ago and it states that more then 45% of middle schoolers in U.S.A has to take some kind of vitamin medicine as the dont eat their lunch properly because they watch t. So less use of technology gives us positive effects and more use of it gives us negative effects. According to me, I think that technology has change people's style of living.

Technology in today's life is, so advance that it has both positive and negative impact on people's life. It has both type of impact negative and positive and it impact's on our life, but the main thing is \"how and when we use it\". This leads to no physical activity, which slow downs physical development of our body",
      "ai_text": "\n\nTechnology also has a notable impact on learning, both in terms of the quantity and quality of the learning experience. On one hand, technology has made learning easier and more accessible by providing access to educational material and resources at any time and any place. While technology provides numerous positive effects for our lives, it also has numerous negative consequences. Additionally, encouraging physical activity and setting aside time for self-care activities such as reading and playing sports can help people discover a healthier lifestyle.. With so much time spent on devices and screens, people are becoming increasingly sedentary, leading to obesity and other physical health issues. \n\nIn order to reap the benefits of technology while mitigating the negative impacts, it is important to set boundaries and practice healthy device usage. On the other hand, technology has made it easier for people to become absorbed in entertainment and social media, resulting in a decrease of focus on more important topics or educational activities that require more in-depth engagement. Technology can help people become more productive with tools such as online calendars and task management apps. Modern technology has improved the quality of life of people, especially those who lead an active lifestyle by increasing the range of activities available to them. However, technology can also lead to distraction and over-dependence \u2013 people can become overwhelmed by the vast number of tasks and end up spending an excessive amount of time on their devices trying to stay on top of their workload. \nTechnology has become an integral part of modern life with its presence felt everywhere from the workplace to the home. Additionally, the development of gaming technology has been linked to a decrease in physical activity among children, which can have a negative effect on their overall growth and development. \n\nFinally, technology has also had an impact on time management and lifestyle changes. \n\nOne of the major positive impacts of technology is the ability to enhance physical growth. A great example of this is the development of specialized physical training software and devices, such as fitness trackers and sports gear, that can be used to chart progress and set goals for athletes of all levels.\n\nOn the other hand, technology can also have a harmful effect on physical health. Limiting the use of phones, tablets, and computers to certain times, or utilizing digital wellness solutions such as screen time trackers, can help people find the right balance between technology and their other interests and activities",

Research topics such as physical growth, learning, time management, and lifestyle changes. Use examples to support your conclusions and suggest ways to mitigate the negative impacts."

I think we shoul keep folllowing the plan thatbis already planted by the goverment.\n\nThe reason are so many and complicated to explain right now, that is why I am only gonna explain and give example to three of those reason. One of them are that students should not go to college at very early age or go to the minlatary at very early age, Because of the their are not older anough and are not anough responsible handle to much presur in college and in high school, and most ot the time they don't really know what they want to be when grow up, and the course during summer and evenings are not much presur for the students.\n\nThey don't have the experience about what is life look like and how harts it is.

As a result, students will be better prepared for whatever career they plan to pursue. \n\nThrough elective courses, students are able to explore different topics and open themselves to new possibilities. Ultimately, taking the time to evaluate all of one's options is key to making an informed decision.. \nWhen it comes to deciding whether to take college classes or enter the military at an early age, it is important for students to consider all of their options and make an informed decision. By taking elective courses outside of a student's comfort zone, they can gain vital skills such as creativity and problem-solving. By trying out different courses, students can deepen their understanding of their preferred subject and gain an insight into potential future paths. Elective courses offer students a way to express their interests and figure out what they truly desire.

Many times teens are challenged by their friends in order to do something that can cause fatalities or a great success. Humans are being influenced constantly by different people and ways of thinking, but he most effective ways to influence others are: peer pressure, advises from others and social stereotypes\n\nMost adolescents are extremely insecure and need their friends's approval. Generic_Name's grandfather was a well-known writer and gave many advises to Generic_Name about how to write good essays. after all that, Generic_Name has been awarded with different prices and many scholarships that required essays.\n\nEvery culture have different societal rules, but each rule can influence and shape anyone as a person. stereotypes can affect anyone.\n\nThe most effective ways to influence others are: peer pressure, advises and social stereotypes. When Generic_Name went to Dubai, she decided to wear a hijab although she was not Muslim because if she did not wear it, people would look at her with contempt, this shows how social. Old people advises are the most effective because of their great wisdom and erudition. A poll by a student from San Antonio high school shows that 92% of people between 14-21 years have been influenced by others. If all humans were influenced by good people with good intentions, life would be easier, and there would never be a lack of good poeple trying to influence other on the way of success and saintliness..

Furthermore, when combined with social stereotypes, our behaviour and beliefs can become limited and even harmful. \n\nThrough recognizing the impact of advice from others, peer pressure and social stereotypes, we can gain a greater understanding of the effect they can have on individuals. We must be aware of these influences and strive for self-acceptance and tolerance of others. I was constantly told what I should and shouldn't be doing, who I should and shouldn't be friends with, and how I should and shouldn't dress. We must be mindful of our own personal values and convictions, as well as those of others, to be better able to stay true to ourselves and break down the barriers of social norms.. With this insight, we can work to develop more confidence in ourselves and our beliefs, so that we can shape our own paths and break away from the constraints of social expectations. I struggled to be who I wanted to be versus who others expected me to be. \n\nIn conclusion, it is essential to be conscious of the power that these influences can have in shaping our beliefs and behaviour.

That is what the Former British Prime Minster once said that \"Success consits of going from failure to failure without the loss of enthusiam.\" How would you know your going to fail to pursuit for success?\n\nWhat is success? Success is to achieve goals you been wanting to accomplished. No one is perfect,it's understanding to make a couple of mistakes here and there knowing you can learn from it.\n\nEveryone wants to be successful in life or in anything. Everyone wants to accomplished something or anything. No matter how many times you keep making mistakes it won't stop you from what you are doing or trying to get. You can be still successful no matter how much you fail because it will make you smater for success.\n\nSuccess is something that many have achieved or have not but at the end of the day were resposiable for any mistakes,actions and verbal language that we have used,It could affected anyone or anywhere. It feels extraordinary to be successful in life but to fail is something that no one likes including to success.

It's understandable to make mistakes because you can learn from them and try again until you get it right.

Therefore, it is important to remain positive and motivated despite any negative consequences of failure.\n\nIt is clear that failure and success exist in equal balance, and it is important to recognize that failure is not the end.

I believe that the source of true self-esteem is by praising a student's work because that could help them grow more independent. When some one is praised for their work, it makes them feel good and makes them want to do more work. other students dont care if they graduate or not because for them being \"popular\" and not listening to the teacher, and disrupting the class and doing what ever they want it more important than learning and getting an education.\n\nHaving a strong self confidence, being independent and willing to learn more are some examples of praising a student's work. and always putting a lot of effort in school, those kinds should always be recognized and praised, because they show how mature they are and how willing they are to graduate and have a good job. If a student is willing to learn and put a lot of effort in work, that makes them mature because it shows how willing they are to learn. when a student is willing to learn that is the true motivation that is considered being able to achieve more work and do it more efficiently and with more confidence.\n\nThird reason, When a students is willing to learn a lot and are always on track, paying attention, and turning in work on time. They believe that the source of true self-esteem is achievement. their work should be more praised. It emphasizes that they are capable of working independent and being able to have a good job. and that is why it is good to praise a student's work.  . when a student is willing to put a lot of effort into the work. Some people think, that praise that is given for deficient work undermines learning by lowering standards. By praising a student's work, they are going to be able to; work efficiently independent, have a bigger self confidence, and learn better.\n\nFirst reason, When a student's work is praised that helps them achieve there work more efficiently. One topic that is frequently debated is \"Does true self-esteem come from praise or does it come from achievement\". A student's work should not get praised for their work if they didnt put any effort in the work because that would just make them want to not put any effort in the work, because they will think that they would get the same grade as someone that actually tried and actually wanted to get a good grade for something that they put so much effort into.\n\nSecond reason, When a student has a big self confidence that helps them get their work done more constant and with more effort because they know that they can do it and that are capable of having a good grade",

True self-esteem can only be derived from a sense of accomplishment or success. If praise is used in this manner, it may actually do more harm than good by instilling in the student a false sense of achievement and security.\n\nWhile praise can be an important factor in a student's overall success, it cannot be the sole source of true self-esteem. In these cases, the student is not being held to a high enough standard and has little incentive to strive for excellence. Ultimately, both praise and achievement can be essential tools for helping students develop self-esteem, but ultimately achieving success is the best way for students to gain a true sense of self-worth..

However I believe that people are always being influence for someone else without maybe they noticing, that is why I think there is always someone looking at us and maybe we are not paying attention, but our actions and reactions is the only example we can give to others to follow.\n\nI also believe that actions speaks louder than words, that is why for us to be the influence over someone else's life there is nothing better than our own behavior.

People follow others because they like the other person's personality does not matter is it good or bad. Also other people might say that people act and react to situations depending on how they feel at the moment and how the situation was based on.

It is no mistake that the perception of education in our society is of the utmost importance; we associate success with education, something that is passed down to us in various ways from school.

      "ai_text": "Having a positive mindset and being kind to others is an essential part of fostering a compassionate and understanding community. \n\nResearch has shown that providing acts of kindness leads to higher levels of satisfaction and happiness in people. \n\nIn conclusion, small acts of kindness have far-reaching impacts on both the doers and recipients, and should be encouraged. \nSmall acts of kindness can have an impact on others that goes far beyond just the doer and recipient. He found that \"acts of kindness, regardless of whether or not others notice them, significantly increase happiness\" in the people performing them. Additionally, research suggests that kindness is contagious and can create opportunities in people\u2019s lives by opening doorways to positive physical and mental health benefits, improved relationships, and increased success. Parents must create an environment in which kindness is emphasized, and they must teach their children to be kind. Kindness can be as simple as offering words of encouragement, volunteering time to help others, or even just sharing a smile with a stranger. Other studies have shown that recipients of kind acts are eight times more likely to pass on that kindness to someone else than they are to pass on negative behavior, resulting in a ripple-effect of kindness that can be felt in our communities.\n\nHaving a positive mindset is key to understanding and promoting kindness, and this starts with the role that parents play. In 2009, Stephen Post, director of the Center for Medical Humanities, Compassionate Care and Bioethics at Stony Brook University, conducted a study involving 1,000 people. These small acts of kindness can leave a lasting impression and brighten someone\u2019s day. Kindness can create opportunities in people's lives, and parents are vital in setting an example for young generations to come. This is something that requires effort and dedication; setting a good example and encouraging open discussions on how kindness can be demonstrated are great ways to foster this values in children. ",

      "ai_text": "Some have argued that curfews are too restrictive, and may result in teens feeling like they are not trusted or respected. \n\nOn the other hand, there are also drawbacks of having a curfew for teenagers. Teens need an average of 8.5 to 9.5 hours of sleep to help with physical and mental development, and having a timely curfew that is consistently enforced can help ensure that teens get the sleep they need. Additionally, some teens may be living in unfavorable home environments and could benefit from having more time away from home, which a curfew could take away. \nCurfews often have a bad reputation; they are seen as too restrictive and something that will take away teenagers' freedom. To truly evaluate the pros and cons of having a curfew for teenagers, one must consider careful evidence-based arguments for each side.. Research has also shown that getting enough sleep can help improve mood, reduce memory issues, and strengthen mental health.\n\nCurfews can also help reduce instances of illegal activities. It can also create a feeling of rebellion in teens and increase the chances of them breaking the curfew, leading to more legal issues. Since teens are more likely to commit crimes after dark, having a curfew that places limits on the amount of time teenagers can stay out can reduce the likelihood of these activities. But imposing a curfew on teenagers can have both positive and negative effects. \n\nOverall, while a curfew for teenagers can help promote healthy sleep schedules and possibly reduce illegal activities, it can also have negative ramifications and may make teens feel restrained in their freedom. \n\nOne of the major benefits of having a curfew for teenagers is that it can help them establish a consistent sleep schedule",

Longs she lets us in her life, thats good enough for us.\n\nLast reason is you still are the main person in your life, so no matter what you do your life, just remember it your life is your alone, and you are the only one who can change the outcome of your future. And you are the only person who can change the outcome of your life. But long as she listened that good enough for me.\n\nThe second reason is people don't have any saying in your life, yes its true, but theres people willing to help you through your life. So one day I gave her some ideas, but she didn't want any, because she don't want to do them, but next day, she gave some of my ideas a try and she like it but still don't want to do it anymore. But its okay, because she know that we want to help her, because we care about her,so we will not stop trying to help her. Because the other person could probably be wrong with somethings. But you should hear them out so you can get something out of thing. But no matter what they are still willing to help me. For example I'm 18 years ago, and i'm still having problems in my life, but there are people that are willing to help me, but i'm scared at no matter what i'm still feeling down with stuff. even though you don't want the help, its still good to get some advice from others.. even If you want the help of others or not. even so your the main person in your life, its okay to hear others out even though they are wrong sometimes or if they are sometimes right.\n\nThe first reason is that its okay if you don't want the other person's help. For example my friend Generic_Name, she love to write stories and love to sing, and dance, but she too embarrassed to do what she love. Also the other person doesn't have any saying in your life, if you don't want them to. And i'm happy, so yeah thats good for me.\n\nSo basically, NO MATTER WHAT THERE'S ALWAYES WILL BE PEOPLE WHO WANTS TO HELP YOU.

This is good, because students would have to rely on themselves, and have responsibilities. Students won't need a loan if they work, and the parents would not have to worry about the money. Matter of fact I believe that students should graduate in three years and work, because they would save money for college, they will be mature for college, and they would have time management skills. If you have all of that set, then you don't have to worry about being late or not turning anything on time, because they would already have the time management skills and you would be used to it already.\n\nI believe that others might disagree with me and say that students should go to college right away, but with all do respect I believe that students would gain a lot of opportunities if they work before going to college, because if you go to college and you aren't mature enough, then you will struggle.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that students who work before going to college, will gain a lot in life and they will be ready for college. Because they wouldn't have to worry about paying the loan off after college, they would have a better time management skills than others will, and they will become more mature by being responsible and handling it themselves. If students get out of school in three years, then they have the chance to work and save money for college. This will show others that you matured, and will make your parents proud.\n\nSecondly, students who work will be more mature, because they would have to rely on themselves, have lots of responsibilities, and they would understand the outside world better. . 75% of the time students graduate early to go to college. Time management skills will help you in school by, turning things on time, not being late to class, and sleeping early for the class you have the other day. But if you do work that one year you graduate early, then you will get into college the same year your friends are, and you won't have to worry about being alone.\n\nLastly, Some students don't turn in school work on time. Some students who graduate early tend to be 17 years old. Some students get bullied, because they are younger than everyone else, and we do want that happening to anyone. This will help students gain lots of opportunities before college.\n\nFirst, students would have the opportunity to save money for college. If they do the one year work force, then they would gain money and become more mature. It also helps you by having a time for each thing you do, like studying, working, playing, relaxing, and sleeping. Being mature will make you an adult, and make others take you serious, not a joke. Work could gain the student time-management skills, because they would have to be at work on time, do what they have asked to do on time, and never be late. Some students like to get a loan for college, because they don't have enough money, and parent's can't support him/her. Maturity matters, because students need to understand how to turn in work to their professor on time. Time management skills isn't only for being late and turning work in on time, time management is also important for setting a time to sleep and to wake up",

Furthermore, the experiences gained from working will help mature students and provide them with skills such as time management that will be invaluable in college.

I can control myself to do the right thing and their many teenager that dosen't know how to be yourself because it takes lots of controling your character. This is also supports how i act to other and be truth to myself. Character formed by influence beyond my control i do have many ressons to support this prompt do i choose my own character formed that is real by influences beyond control that i have over myself is my action and my thoughts that able to do the right thing as my character choose to be make it right. This prompt support that i am able to have my own character. My pass what make me more strong and to be brave to control my self to choose make it all the way. Influence beyond control your mind but it mean you have to strong and kind to other. The Britesh naturalist and politician and John Lubbock wrote this quote and i do believe that i can control what i said and i also control what are my action are that not usless to me because it's importan to me by influence beyond control take a position on this issue. i support that my character is influence because i control myself and the rest of is you body do the rest in science that are study knowledge about human body but it's nothing to do with this but your character tell you how to choose and be youself. Sometimes i am not proude of who i am but it's not about who you are it about what you do and and what you said. The british naturalist is right because people make bad chooice sometime it dosen't mean they are bad. Sometime you don't have to be selfish but their many selfish human being that do the wrong things and they know what they doing even that were wrong. I choose to make it right because that is who i am and it make me more stronger every time i am controling my action and that may not be the problam as the respond stay the same ans iam supporting this because i also do believe in myself that i do really can think postivie and do the right things by influence beyone my control.. For example i did losed control went i am not thinking postivie and choosing to be nagative that's why people need to know how to be able to control them self. Thinking postivie is't force it's come by influences and the people you around with not always the you round with their know how to control them sefl but it is not them that you can't depond on you have to learn your own and not all people are bad to hanging out with. it is positible to my character will be what me and myself choose to make it right, my responds with this prompt that is i can control my character will be show as i think postivie and do the right thing to improve my self that i can control my to be make it thru all the way as i'm useing character formed by influences beyond. Your character tell you to support your respond to other that you choose away you can control yourself. I make misstake and l can learn from my own mistack that are right. I do agree with this quote because my character will be what i can just be myself and choose the right thing to make it right. It wasn't easy i work really heard to be the person that i am now my jerueny the reasons that i know how to be able to controling my self. Some teen that are don't know how to control them self but you really don't have to know how to control your self they're many reasons influence that control youe self that you don't have control over what you have is you control you i know went i frist nocite that i have to make everything right but it is not what i have change it is what i am. Character influence beyond and it takes many reasons to be able to do the right thing i support that influence do control our character that we have and it make it more hearder to believe that i know what is the right and wrong thing as the time goes but my responds has to be the same i can't not change what other people do or said but what i can do is just be myself and think postivie that what makes it my character right. I believe that one person can change the whold world just by their bravery and thinking postivie to them self i may not be prefact but i know how to control myself just by thinking postivie and think before i said or do anythigs. My influences that control my action that i am able to do the right thing and think postivie as same time my undestaning one anouther that support that what other may feel. I can control my actions and my thoughts that will not hurting other but if they're someone is not nice to me i can just use my postivie thought and postivie mind to control my nagaitve thoughts and use my postivie thoughts not to be bad as their to me. John Lubbock was right i do control my character formed by influences beyond that my brain tells me to do. My character makes me who i am now even went i wasn't my self. I control myself to do bad and good things i can only control me and my action that can be a issue. I tell myself that you are not perfact but doing the right things that isn't issue but the issue is when people take it wrong way and you can't do or said anythings. My character will show that how much i can control myself to be myself and not to be the person that other want me to be. Life isn't easy to know everything you have to thougt your self to live in this world there many people even don't know what is to be able to love yourself and do the right thing.

However, I believe that online classes can be difficult or tough on a student. . Many have jobs, others just like to sleep, they'll forget they have a class online and forget to turn in the work. For example, The time I took an online class for art, it was terrible, either I didn't know how to transfer my painting to the computer or I just didn't know how to draw the picture. Online classes don't send out reminders of the assignment so any student can easily forget and fall behind the rest of the class.\n\nIn conclusion, online schooling isn't very beneficial.

Example; in a company every employer have his own rights like what time they need to be there or what time they get out the work.\n\nThe reason why i shoose disagree is because to many people in this world do not respect when you make your own decision, if you can do something do not worry about what people say",

Once you accept yourself and the unique perspectives and values that make you who you are, you are better able to take part in meaningful conversations and experiences with others, as well as navigate through life\u2019s demands.. Ignoring or repressing your emotions can only lead to distress in the long run. They might take on certain attitudes or interests that do not reflect their true values. \n\nUnfortunately, many people look to others around them and feel as if they need to conform in order to fit in. This can lead to a kind of disconnect between the person's inner self and their external self which can cause many difficulties in life.\n\nThe best way to counteract this is to make sure that you take the time to know yourself, understand your values, and trust in your opinions. \n\nIt is easy to allow external forces to shape your identity, but asserting and embracing your own identity is the most rewarding path in life. You must make the effort to stand up for your convictions, regardless of the demands of those around you. It can be hard to remain true to yourself amidst the arguments, pressures, and judgements of others. It is important to remember that no one else can decide how you should live your life. Furthermore, it is important to assert your emotions and acknowledge what you are feeling. \n\nIn a world filled with various opinions, values, and beliefs, it is all too easy to feel lost and confused",

Childhood is very important because it is the the base of the building this is where person starts building their knowledge.       . These are the three main reasons that differentiate people's characters, and makes them good in their own way.\n\nEach person has had a different childhood which is an important part of people's characters. Each person has different characteristics based on their culture, environment, childhood makes difference in their character. Childhoods can effect kids when they grow up in a lot of different ways. If everyone had the same characteristics life would not be as good as it is now. At the end of the day all characters are good in their own way, the difference between people is what makes them stand out and complete each other. A lot of teachers in the middle east hit their students when they do not do homework or get a bad grade on a test, this makes the students not wanting to go to school and hating school because they get hit in front of their friends, this does not give students enough confidence which is going to effect their characters in the future. Sometimes culture does not give the person the freedom they need for example, in the middle east sex before marriage is not allowed which makes a lot of difference in peoples characters making them do secret stuff and not being able to communicate with the other gender because they are not even allowed to talk to each other because of culture.\n\nIn conclusion people do not get to choose their character. Culture is what is going on around the person and what he believes in or does not believe in. Children who spend hours and hours on video game and making online friends, this make them anti-social people when they get older.\n\nPeople's environment such as work place, friends has a lot of effects on their characters. This is a very important topic and it means a lot to me and other people Thank You for giving me the change to talk about it. Culture makes people religious, pray and be good people. Sometimes cultures effect the person's character in good ways sometimes in bad ways. In work if a person is working and his manager yells at him that will lower his self confidence and have a negative impact on his character.\n\nCulture has a big impact on a person's character in a lot of different ways. If a person has a lot of bad friends that person's character is not gonna be the same as a person who hangs around with good friends, for example if a guy has friends who do drugs even if does not do them step by step they are going to get him to do it and that will start making changes in his character, on the other hand if a person has good friends who tell him let's go to the library to read or study that will have a positive effect on that person,s character. We do not choose our own character, if everyone gets to choose their own character nobody will have any bad people in this world, everyone would be full of good things because they will be able to pick their characteristics",
      "ai_text": "Those experiences, as will their environment, shape the way the person behaves and reacts to life. The culture of the community is the basis of shared norms and values, such as respect for elders and cooperation among peers. Through the lens of childhood, environment, and culture, a person can come to understand how multiple facets of a person's formative life events have molded their character today.. \nChildhood, environment, and culture are all integral factors and building blocks for forming a person's character. In contrast, a positive environment may encourage a child to be more social, compassionate, and imaginative. A person's environment is the place in which they interact with people and the world, in a positive or negative manner. These can form the core values of the mindset, providing the basis for a person's ethical views and interpersonal attitudes.\n\nThe overall effect of these key factors in a person's development helps define their character and determine how they react and interact in society. The culture shapes a person's beliefs, attitudes, and values while surrendering to certain ways of life in the community.\n\nGrowing up, a child is exposed to a diverse range of people, situations, and beliefs. Childhood lays the foundation for essential skills, relationships, and beliefs that shape the person\u2019s sense of identity for years to come. A negative environment, for example, may cause the child to grow to be anxious and insecure",

It has been said that working with a group benefit more than working alone because it can be more fun. I agree that working with teammates can help us feel better and they push us to be better . We enjoyed talking and eating but we never talked about the project. Working alone can save our time because we can work at home, we don't need to wait for the rest of the group or even go somewhere else. All the group can work at the same time, some can do the posters, others can look for information, and the rest can divide the information about what theme each one is going to talk during the presentation. A survey showed that a faster way to work is working in groups because all the team can work in different areas at the same time. For example, last year, my Science teacher gave us a group assignment where we needed to meet each other outside of school. For example, before doing a class work I always have to ask my teacher if what I'm thinking is correct because my mind gets freeze out. Thank you for taking your time to read my paper, I hope you understand why I prefer working with a group.. Have you ever been in a situation where you feel alone and you don't want to do any homework.

These days they are unstoppable for what they do sometimes they are good more than adult at committing to career when it comes to what they want to do in life.\n\nSome people might argue that students identify a career by the time they enter high school , because they think some students can not do that when it comes to committing to career they think that young teens can not do it .Because technology has taken the mind of teens .They say that teens can not do anything because all they think about is technology and all the things they do they always use technology so some people do not believe that teens these day can commit to anything i .Many people believe that it is hard for teens to commit ,because they can not take responsible of what they do and some think that they are so imature .When it comes to committing to career the parents thinks it how they act at home that why they can not commit to career and some thinks it how they behavior when they are in school .Some people believe that teens can not commit to a career ,because they do not know what to do and some thinks that young teens can not do it because they changes their mind most of their time on settling on what they want to do .Bunch of people believe that teenager can not do it because they quite so early and so easily anyway a lot people do say that can can not be a good generation because they do not know what to do.\n\nBut it doe not mean that all teenager are bad some might change when they grow up and some might not change ,because they just do not want to change consoling the thing they might have gone through so for these people. So keep believing in what you want to commit to because once you found it I know for sure whatever it is you will success ,because we you teens work hard for our dream.. When they enter middle school and that when students from elementary school start thinking about their choice and taking their career choice serious ,because that when they start thinking what they want to do in the near future. Students committing to a career when they about to enter high school is by far a great idea. But when it comes to middle school students they can choose what class they want to take for a specific career they have in mind .\n\nStudent can commit to a career when they enter high school , but they do that when the student already know what they want to be or what they want to do by the time they enter high school so the student at they would be committing to what the student want to do so the person doing so chooses the class the person want to study . Who believe that some teens can not commit might be wrong because people change teenager hood do change as well\n\n.\n\nFor these who believe in change I as well believe in change people do change and they can commit to what they want to commit to as well as job, career,family or love. From elementary to middle school students are allowed to choose what they want to study toward a specific career or what they want to be. Elementary students have 4 years where they take class that are chosen for them in the 4 years they study just to get good grade ,but they do not think about choosing the class for themselves .But when it comes to 5th grade they still study the class that are chosen for them except that when they start to think what if I could choose the class that I want to study for my career or what kind job I am going to study to be able to get that job and that how they start committing to a career .when it comes to elementary school students.\n\nMiddle school students are commit to career because they are teens and they have to think about a lot of things that they want to do personally when it comes to career or what they want to be when they grow up that when they start .Committing to career start in elementary , but mostly it begins for real in middle school because that when young teens start taking class like algebra,earth science,biology ,world history, etc . When looking you will find a lot teens thinking about their career .The career they want to commit to and some teens do change want they want to be , but still they are committing to it and they can just change if they do not want to do it .For some reasons young teens around the world that are still in middle school are already commit to a career and that is a good thing right most of them are really into it , and they are taking their career far enough .So far like 10,00 teens are most famous because of their career that they are doing now and they take serious because they like and they are good at it mostly middle school teens. When kids are still in elementary they can say what they want to be, but they can not choose the class for the specific reason because they are still kids. When middle school students start taking these class students think only about passing so that they can not repeat that class and some just want to pass the class but mostly it about passing the class so that they can be able to get credit, and that leads to taking the class the will help that person career or what kind of career they are into. Students committing to a career is a great idea when you really want to do it .\n\nCommitting to career\n\nWhen elementary students are in 5th grade they start carefully thinking about what they are gonna do,\n\nbecause when they are in 5th grade it their last year in elementary school so they have to think about what they want to do",
      "ai_text": "On the other hand, middle school students start to recognize the consequences of their decisions and may begin to commit to a career path. \n\nUnfortunately, many adults may view teenagers as too inexperienced or immature to decide on a career. Ultimately, committing to a career at a young age requires the willingness to learn and the patience to maneuver through an ever-changing landscape.. Elementary school students are typically unaware of the concept of a long-term job and tend to approach career choices from a more whimsical perspective. Moreover, due to their age, there are limits to the degree of responsibility they can take on. Young people can demonstrate the breadth of their experience and knowledge which shows that not all adolescents are the same.\n\nEven with the ambition and drive to pursue a career, teenagers still face unique challenges. \nAs students begin to develop a sense of individual identity, the career paths they pursue change drastically. However, this belief fails to acknowledge the reality of the modern world in which teenagers can commit to long-term goals earlier on. This age group may also begin to explore the creation of a resume and the development of professional skills. They may not have the educational background or internships necessary to enter professional fields",

Describe the differences between elementary and middle school students and how they approach career choices.\n3. Analyze why people may belief that teenagers cannot commit to a career.\n4.

School required students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during the break. It is going to be more fun if you get to choose your own design for the summer project because i can get to make it with my friends and probably family members. Cristiano Ronaldo is a soccer star but he went to high school and know what the students want to do and design. It is better for the students to design their own summer project because they have better ideas, Can make their projects less stressful, and make it more fun with their friends.\n\nAll students in the world have better ideas to how to design your own project and make it better. When students get to design there own project is less stressful for them because they can choose how they want to do it.\n\nLeonel Messi came to every high school in the united states to talk about how stressful is when teacher give students projects over the summer. Messi told us that when he was in high school,he used to choose his own design of project because it was less stressful and more fun to do. Everyone keep saying that teachers should make the designs of students projects for the summer.\n\nStudents of everywhere can make there project design less stressful if they get to choose what they can do. Students have better understanding of what they want to do for there project like having better ideas and knowing what they want to work on. The mother of my friend ones told me that there is nothing more fun than getting to design a project as a student.        . She told me that when she was in high school their teacher choose the project for them and that wasn't fun for no student. When students pick their design they don't need to worry about asking question to their teacher and stressing out. While some people around the world say that teachers should design the summer project for the students. That's why she told me that is more fun to get to choose your own design of project because when teachers get to choose them is super boring and stressful students sometimes cry. Students around the world have a ruff time trying to do projects that their teacher gives them over the summer. He talk to us that picking our own projects is way better than teachers picking the design because we can make our own ideas and it is less stressful and that is going to be easier. Never let your teacher choose design the summer project for the students.\n\nWhile other people might say that these summer projects should be teacher designed because the student keep learning more and keep working hard;however, if students make their own summer project design it is way better because student have better ideas, less stressful, and get to have more fun while doing the project. Every student around the world should start making their own design for their project. Messi gave us a great talk about how to choose your own design of project can make every students less stressful. He wrote on the article that students brain is still developing;he said that if students keep making their own decision and teachers let them choose their designs of projects they can come up with better ideas that other people cannot even think about. In the article he wrote that we students have a amazing brain and we can come u with the best ideas and design of projects that no one else can't. when people keep saying that teacher should choose our design it so stressful because us as student want to choose our design for our summer project.\n\nPeople in all high schools keep saying that is more fun for students to make our design of project ,because it makes our studies more fun and incredible. The time we live on right now students should get projects over the summer, so they can prepared for college and other things in life this is why the schools are giving them work so they dont forget about school and keep learning everyday. Teachers should let students choose their own design so students can relax and have fun over the summer and they can keep doing there project and still have time to have fun with family and friends. Cristiano Ronaldo wrote a article about why is good students should design their projects and why teacher should let them design their own article. She told me that If i had the chance to make my own design to take it because it was not going to be fun to if the teacher choose the design",
      "ai_text": "Real-life examples show that students have sometimes struggled to adhere to the expectations of their teachers when completing summer projects, which reflects how allowing students to design their own projects can be less stressful for them and more enjoyable too. While Ronaldo emphasizes that it encourages creativity and the joy of learning through an independent approach, Messi points out that it provides an opportunity for students to develop a sense of ownership and autonomy over their work. This helps reduce stress levels for students, enabling them to focus on the quality of their work and curate something unique and insightful. \nFamously competitive rivals, Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi both agree that allowing students to design their own summer projects can be immensely beneficial for their overall academic growth and development. Ultimately, students can benefit from designing their own projects, as it encourages them to be proactive in their learning journey, challenge their own limits, and embrace the creative freedom available to them.",

      "human_text": "This new inspiration will affect how my art grows, which is a reflection of how much I have grown as a person. We need growth.\n\nLimiting what you do, causes you to shrink. Once you stop doing and learning, dissatisfaction (and sadness) consumes your life and leads to a dangerous path. Emerson was right and very wise about what he stated. Dissatisfaction has become a normal and almost natural part of my existence, which makes life much harder than it has to be. We can learn to do new things that we love and get to know ourselves better. We are always looking for something new. How will I bring something new to the table when all I know is what the past musicians have discovered and put together? My only option is to replicate and do over what has been done. It is part of our nature, curiosity.\n\nEven the things you are passionate about will lose their meaning. We need to do other stuff that we are not as passionate about to know what we are actually passionate about. Learning is what we spend most of our human lives doing; when you stop learning, you almost stop living -because what are you going to do then? Do the same things over and over again? You will always eventually reach a point when you are not even satisfied with what you do and know.\n\nI think we all have struggled with dissatisfaction at many points of our lives, it is as if we have reached a point where we do not know what to do next. It was not always much of a choice, but now it is. I have reached points where I could not be with anyone because I was stuck in a group of people that I did not like. Imagine me, a two-year guitar player with dreams of become a musician/music producer, going to college to study music and only music (mastering the guitar and only the guitar). There are always parts of you that you do not know or have not discovered because you limit your loves. It is true that as soon as you stop learning, you stop growing as a person. You complicate the human experience and it makes you shrink as a person, something you should avoid doing (you should always be going after growth). I still get to those points sometimes, and I get sad very easily because I am unsatisfied with my friendships. The stuff that used to bring us joy have been overdone and gotten boring, we need something new. I have always put limits to the kind of people I can become friends with. Life gets irritating. We should always be going after growth.. It might be a bit unrealistic, we all know we have to take multiple classes to get a degree, but imagine if that was my only things. We never reach complete satisfaction. As has been said before, we need to get to know things that we do not love to know what we love; it makes everything you love much more meaningful when you have to get to know something that you do not like.\n\nDoing things beyond what we have mastered helps us to grow and be happier. I will need to find a new inspiration, a new thing to influence my music besides my music studies. Satisfaction restricts creativity; you start doing the same things over and over again, and like a scratched disc, the music gets irritating. Limitation in most cases is not a good thing.\n\nSure, many might say mastering on something that you love takes you through all the processes you need to grow as a person, but that is putting limits to how you grow and what you love",
      "ai_text": "It is wise to endeavor to constantly learn new things and strive further than our current capabilities -- continually striving for more can help us become more confident, rounded individuals. This can be detrimental to our own personal growth, both professionally and personally. There is much to be said for widening one's perspective and expanding our knowledge.. Dissatisfaction is natural and healthy, as it often encourages us to strive for more and become better versions of ourselves, however it can also be dangerous if taken too far. This is reflected in Emerson's statement that \"we should always be going after growth,\" as people are constantly gaining knowledge and pushing boundaries to reach some semblance of harmony in their lives. \nOften times, we find ourselves self-imposing limitations in areas of our lives where we feel we do not excel, or where we are uncomfortable",

They can turn in a good homework or proyect with more information explained. Some people are agree with these class, because classes in online it's bennefit and better for students, students can learning more, students can do a better work, and students can have a more time for to spend with the family. But if they study classes in online it's more easy not it's very hard like in the school.\n\nSome people say that the classes online it's a lost time the student do not make nothing in his house, when they have classes online they lost time. For example, when they are in the house they play with the cell phone or they are using his phone for other things, and they not study and not learning like in the shool. However, the classes in online is wonderfure because is a way to spend with the family because they can make a day fun with them and make differents things like play football, wath a movie, they can go to the cinemark and other places that they prefers.\n\nIn conclucion class online it's benefit from being able to attend classes from home. If the students take a classes online this is benefit for them and have a lot adventages, and they can do the both things work and follow study in online classes and they can follow the goals like find a good job and finish his studies. Should some school offer distance learning for students to attendend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. If the students will can study in classes online they can have a big opportunities and they can follow his dreams and has the all they want to do or they want to has.\n\nOne reason it's classes in online is benefit and better, students can learning more and they can have in the house because they can do a time for make all things they needed make, for example I want to graduate and I want to follow study but it's difficult for me because I don't have time for anything I can't not make my homework, and study for my quizz. For example when the students have more time, they can make a better work, because they are enfocus in his obligation like homework and proyects, and they want to be a good student is for that they can do effort for turn in a good proyects with the use the internet. Because students can lerning more, students can do a better work, and students can have a more time for to spend with the family. This is important and benefit because students can make a lot things, and they have a more time for make a lot things wathever they want. I need to work for buy my things, pay my house and my car. They can do a good investing for make a homework they can find a lot information, if the students are a relax and they have a time they only need to study a few hours no is like in the school.

As such, it is essential that schools embrace this technology and provide the necessary resources to help students take advantage of these opportunities and maximize their potential.. \n\nIt is important to consider both the positive and negative impacts of distance learning. \nDistance learning options have become increasingly popular over the past decade, with growing numbers of students relying on online or video conferencing classes to attend school from home. In addition, many students who may feel overwhelmed by the more traditional environment find increased comfort and freedom in the home-based setting. While the ability to learn from one's own home offers numerous advantages - such as increased flexibility, lower costs, and more control over one's schedule - there are still a number of potential issues that must be taken into account, such as the potential for students to become easily distracted or procrastinate. On one hand, there is evidence that distance learning can offer superior academic outcomes due to the focus that students have while working independently",

They feel that because if the school extending two hours more, we can have more time with our friends. One topic is frequetly debated is whether or not should your school follow this model by extending the school day two hours? some people think that because students can learn more. you can help to clean the school and decoring some of the classroom, or you can stay in the library and help to organized the books or doing homework, and we can use the computers to search and find what book we want read.\n\nThird reason why the school days can extending two hours is because some students want to stay in the school doing projects or homework because they don't have time to do in their home some of they go to work, and others students have alot of homework from the others clases, and that's one reason why the teachers be mad with the student because they did not do his homework, and the students explain why he not did that homework we have alot of homework from the others clases and i don't have to much time to do all the homework i have because at night i got to the bed early and the next day some teachers give me more homework and that's why i don't do your homework.\n\nThe last reason why the school days can extending two hours is because some students need help with their homework, they need to practice more to understand the class but the most important thinks that students need to have are good grades and pass all the test to graduated, if they have very good grades the school will give a certificated to saying we are proud of you, and your family will give to you some gifts because they are proud of you ,and you will graduated without trouble and then any university will accept to you because they will see your grades of your colleges and see how good you was in your clases.\n\nIn conclusion why the school days can extending two hours is because most students want to stay in the school to participated in activities of the school or participated in some football teams.. We have bad grades because the class is boring or the teacher is great with the students and she don't say anything when we are using our phones.\n\nSecond reason why the school days can extending two hours is because you can participated in school activities or, you can play in some games like Soccer, American football, basketball, and you can have more time with your friends and helping the soccer team. Students have bad grades because they don't listening to the teacher while she's explain",

With additional time, students could benefit from smaller class sizes, less competition for resources and access to more subjects. \n\nHowever, extending the school day by two hours could have potential negatives as well. Furthermore, without adequate compensation, teachers may struggle to accommodate the extra burden, leading to poorer overall educational standards. \nExtending the school day by two hours could potentially provide students with a number of benefits. Ultimately, a decision should be made carefully, and include taking into consideration things like potential physical and mental health effects, educational benefits and potential community impacts.. A longer school day may mean that fewer people are available to work, as well as decrease job availability for those providing after school activities for children.

Despite this, there is still no denying that forming a positive rapport from the start can open many doors and cause long-term benefits. The interviewer's initial impression of me may have been the deciding factor in landing the job. The ones that put more effort into making positive connections with their peers or colleagues prove to be more successful as well.\n\nIt is essential to remember that first impressions are only part of the equation and do not determine the outcome of the situation. Although I was anxious, I was able to put together a successful interview and went on to receive the position. In this case, my good first impression secured me a job I was highly qualified for but could not have gotten without making a strong initial connection.\n\nThis concept applies to many other areas of life, from relationships to work performance. I have observed in my peers and coworkers that those who present themselves well to their superiors often receive more favorable treatment in the workplace. While the pressure of making a good first impression can be daunting at times, the effort is usually worth it in the end.",

Third reason, some students have some obligations in their homes, for example some of those are: pay cellphone, pay room, buy food, and pay car, so some student take advantages of the summer break to make some money to helps them to pay all their obligations in their homes, and don't take the school's time to spend it in other obligations, and take their time just to teh schools.

For those juggling multiple responsibilities, such as jobs, summer break is a vital opportunity to catch up on rest, spend time with family, and plan for the upcoming school year. It gives them a much needed respite from academic pressures, a precious chance to relax, and the opportunity to pursue hobbies and interests that are not always available during the rest of the year.

Or sometimes you can fall in love but you partener might have a better character then you, so you decide to change your character by choosing your partener's character, and that is why we should choose our own character.\n\nA lot of people choose thier character when they start school, because they see a lot of diffrent characters in school and they start noticing which character belongs to them. We do not choose our charater whitout knowing ourself, and that is why it is better to choose our character by knowing what is best for ourself. You can not pretend to be the character that you do not choose to be, that is just like living a fake life.

We can learn new knowledge, do sports, review everything we learn, and so on. However, there are some new students from different countries, they can not speak English very well,they need more time to study. It's quiet when we study at home. Students can use these time fully. In the winter ,the sun sets up so early, the day is short, it's too dangerous for the students who walk home.\n\nSecond, we have about seven hours in the school every day, I think we need more time to study at home. If the school board adds one and a half hours to school each day, students will attend their activities late. The students in the high school must sleep for about eight hours every day. If they do not sleep very well at night, they will not have good mentality to study next day, their grades may decline.\n\nThese are my reasons, I disagree to expend the school day. The activity lasts about 2 hours or later, students may get home after the sun sets up.

It was a good impression in the end we broke-up in a few days, but we still friends her mom still remembers me that good. It's not based on my experienced, but one my best friend's that we go back a long way in middle school. If you only have personality that good or have charisma that even greater to have, sighing out. I never had a hard time making friends, because I have personality and charisma this two things you need to have if you wanna be friends with someone or making a first impression.

Personality, on the other hand, is about presenting the best version of yourself in any given situation, and is something that can be worked on with practice. \n\nTo illustrate my point, consider the following scenario: I recently met someone who I felt an immediate dislike for. Ultimately, it\u2019s important to give people the benefit of the doubt and be willing to give them a chance.. It also taught me that it\u2019s important to be open-minded and willing to give people a chance regardless of first impressions.\n\nIn conclusion, first impressions can be changed. Charisma is often seen as an innate quality, but it can also be developed over time, as people learn how to use gestures, expressions, and body language to influence the people around them",

Explain why having both charisma and personality is important for creating a good first impression. Give examples of different scenarios where the idea of first impressions was challenged."

      "human_text": "Of course that i'm agree with Churchill's statement, because for to have success or to be successful in the life you need to have many failures. No matter how many times you need to do it, just try it!!!.\n\nThe failure plays a important role for be successful, everybody has ups and downs, for example:\n\nIn the school, if you have a test and you were studying for that test but you fail, don't stop just try it again and try do it better the next time.\n\nFor a job, if you are searching a new job and you completed many applications for any job but no one is requesting you for a interview, or unfortunately, you not were accepted on that job, don't matter, you will find another job, just don't loss the enthusiasm.\n\nIn a relationship, if you like a girl or boy and you declare your love at her/him but you not were accepted for her/him or what's more worse she/he doesn't like you, don't be sad you will find the right one for you.\n\nIn a career, if you wanna have a important job like lawyer but you have a failure in the progress, don't loss your enthusiasm you can try with another profession like nurse or another that you like it.\n\nIn the life, i say in the life because i have a stepfather that he always says that he is right all the time when it's not true but he never want to accept that he are wrong and that't a problem, because if you never listen at the other people that are right then your gonna have a failure in the future, for the same reason that you thought that you were right when you doesn't.\n\nBe successful in the life is not something easy at the contrary it's hard because in the progress you always gonna have many failures, but however, nothing is impossible in the life with enthusiasm and to much effort you gonna achieve many big things, always fight for your dreams and goals. This quote reminds me when my grandfather used to tell me \" Son, if you wanna be someone important on the life your gonna have ups and downs, don't matter how many failures your gonna have, but however, in spite of everything your gonna achieve your goals and dreams without matter what other people says about you, the most important is not loss the enthusiasm\".\n\nI think that if you do your best on everything and you try to do it better always your gonna achieve your goals. You don't need to do it perfect all the time, because despite everything you always gonna have a failure but that doesn't mean that your gonna stop try to do your best or your gonna loss all your enthusiasm, it's mean that despite of each failure your gonna follow your goal. No one is perfect and you don't need to be it for be successful. Remember nobody is perfect on this life and you are strong and intelligent don't matter how many troubles or failures you have just try to do your best and fight for everything that you want.\n\nIn conclusion to have failures is not bad at the contrary is very good for you because you learn more about how to do it better the next time. My mom always say: \" Each failure it's make you more strong and more intelligent \", and the truth that's true, you never gonna learn about your error if you don't have a lesson for to learn but everything without loss of enthusiasm.",
      "ai_text": "Churchill was born into a politically influential family with a seemingly predestined career in politics, making his eventual failure less surprising. Equally, within our own personal lives, we have stories of failure and eventual success. \n\nHistorically, successful leaders such as Winston Churchill and Jeff Bezos serve as reminders that while failure can be disheartening, it is not the end of the road. Therefore, this essay will explore why failure is necessary for eventual success. Churchill served in the military, where he was a failure, and suffered defeats in politics. Nonetheless, he made the leap of faith and invested everything he had into launching Amazon. Resilience Overcomes Failure\nV. These stories often involve resilience over time. Conclusion \n\nDraft: \n\nSuccess is the goal of many, and yet is often a long and arduous journey. And the rest is history: Amazon quickly rose to become one of the largest companies in the world.\n\nSimilarly, stories of personal failure and eventual success are ubiquitous. The common denominator is often resilience.\n\nIf one aspires to success, then it is important to consider one's own relationship to failure. This essay seeks to explore why failure is necessary for eventual success.\n\nOutline: \nI. Historical Examples: Winston Churchill, Jeff Bezos \nIII. Bezos famously took a huge risk in 1996 when he resigned from his highly successful job in finance, with no clear plan for what followed. Introduction\nII. \nSir Winston Churchill, a celebrated statesman, once said, \"Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.\" This inspiring sentiment speaks to the power of perseverance, a sentiment the many successful people of today undoubtedly embody. \n\nTake for example, Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon. Sir Winston Churchill famously said, \"Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.\" This quotation speaks to the power of courage and perseverance, values that are echoed in both famous and personal stories of success. Whether it be a friend who failed out of school yet eventually graduated with honors, or a family member who failed to launch a business only to eventually achieve success with their second venture. Historical examples such as Winston Churchill and Jeff Bezos demonstrate how failure is often a catalyst for eventual success. But, despite the discouragement, Churchill applied his courage and press. Personal Stories of Failure and Success\nIV",

Thats a good thing because learning from your mistake's helps you a lot and benefits the wrong and making mistake's will make you a more successful person. For example, what if i said i wanted to go buy a house, who should i ask to make my decision? no one because you make your own decisions in this life.\n\nThese are the reasons why making your own decisions is better then seeking guidance from experts.. Like for example, if i chose to take geosystems instead of physics i think about it twice because i know what could be the bad thing and the good thing about that class and then go for what i think is better.\n\nSecond reason why i know making your own decisions is better because when a person makes a decision they made, then later regrets what they chose, they made a mistake. For example, if i were to take an exam then get the results that i failed because i got a really bad grade i would try again but wouldnt give up which makes me successful.\n\nFinal reason why i know making your own decisions is better because who else in this world can? Its your life and theres never gonna be a person right by you telling you what do and what not to, so they have to learn by their selfs becuase no one is. I personally know that making your own decisions is better then other people making your decisions because if a expert or other person did, they could probably decide something you dont want and then regret it later in life.\n\nOne reason why i know making your own decisions is better then seeking guidance from experts is becuase when making your own desisions you know what your doing but you have to think twice about it and then go with it",

This gave me the opportunity to explore and learn independently, expanding my knowledge well beyond the preconceived ideas of a single person.\n\nAnother example of why it\u2019s best to make my own decisions can be found in my career. Taking control of my decisions has allowed me to learn and grow far more than any external expert or authority ever could. I did my own research and compared the various programs available to me, ultimately choosing a college that was different from the one recommended to me. Making my own decisions has allowed me to learn, grow, and make choices that reflect my personal beliefs and individual needs.. Rather than trying to follow a predetermined path proposed by someone else, I chose to make my own decisions about what job I wanted. For instance, when it comes to matters of health and wellbeing, I like to do my own research and make decisions that are based on my own understanding of my body and needs. \n\nFor example, when I was deciding what college to attend, I chose to ignore the advice of my high school guidance counselor and followed my own instincts. This enabled me to explore opportunities that I otherwise wouldn\u2019t have been aware of and ultimately led me to a field that I am passionate about and enjoy working in.\n\nFinally, when it comes to important life decisions, I prefer to make my own decisions rather than following the advice of authority figures",

BTS has taught people many things but the one line they said about dancing is \"There are 2 deaths in life. They also inspired me to dance more because ever since I was little I liked dancing and over the years I got better, they kept telling me to keep going which I did and that's when I made up my mind. The first one is when you lose the passion of music and dance and the second one is death. When I became 13 I was able to dance and more like some one was controlling me with strings, like I was a puppet.\n\nNow that I am 14 I decided to teach others who wanted to learn how to dance. After learning to dance hip-hop I felt like an animal that's been let back in the wild. As years passed by and they became the biggest boy band in the whole universe and galaxy! I was inspired by their music but also their dancing, which got me more into dancing. They debuted in 2013 June 13 with their first song called \"No More Dream\". What's the one talent that you have, do you actually want to become better or move on.. when I first got there I was not a good dancer like most of them. They were called BTS. The bone was out of place and the bone was a bit cracked. Hip-hop's really been a big part of my dancing life over years. Since I started taking classes of hip-hop and learning new things, I thought that this might be the number one thing I might actually be good at. Ever since 2012 December 22 I found a group of boys that were new. My number one talent I have it dancing hip-hop because I took classes for 9 years and I got inspired by the artist I mostly love.\n\nMy number one talent is hip-hop. It's been 9 years of dancing so why not. I was now planning to become a back up dancer for them when they went on tour. Once I was there for almost a year I learned a lot because they would tell me little secrets of their's. I had to be careful and not hurt myself again. Ever since you were little, have you ever noticed that your really good at something as you grew over time? Everyone has a talent or a skill that are common or very unique. I took classes at a place and just remembered having so much fun and learning new dance moves. Dancing is a big part of life if you love it and enjoy it. I got better ever since and now I teach my closest friend how to dance. I took dance class for 9 years and it helped me a lot with my dancing skills.\n\nI got inspired by the artist I love the most. I was planning to already become a dancer so I practiced more. After a 8 or 9 weeks I felt better and was able to dance again. My number one talent is dancing hip-hop because I took classes for 9 years and I got inspired but the artiest I love the most. At that moment I was just thinking about the pain but once I got home and was able to rest, I just had the fear of not being able to dance and it made my heart shatter into 7.

I believe that people should take other peoples' guidance from experts and authorities about life's important matter due to people wanting help in the real world, and also tell them about the past so they do not mess up on there life choices.\n\nWhat is more important the choices you make or the outcome of it? Teenagers about my age need to make better choices, but why you may ask. Today Teenagers are just ruining their own life in school. Teens decisions now can affect the decisions they will make sometimes in the future. Someone else decisions can actually change the person you are right now. All I'am just trying to say if you do not like the hits or opinion they are trying to give you just back off and find someone new or just go with the flow and follow what your heart attends you to do. Just something between those lines. Therefore I think teens or people should also ask other people that have already or still is living for a better decisions in important matters.\n\nWhy should I go to someone else for a better decisions for some dumb reason they are going to give me, wrong. Even though they making money that not my passion.        . My recruiter told me to never let someone enter your head with bad thought and let them struggle you with these bad thoughts. For example I changed one of my friends decisions to not drink because that will cause him in the long run, like ever makes it big and someone sends that picture to social media his life can be ruin. If you ask someone, you should actually listen to see what they have to say and understand the concept. Well they have lived longer than you have, they have more experience,and more life choice taking. It is better to have someone else opinion on how to change my decisions. Well people today are just going what their own decisions they make, I am the type of person to ask for some feedback or ask other people about, is this a good choice im making, can I do something better then what I did yesterday. One of his saying was \"yesterday was the past,today is the present,and tomorrow is a mystery\".\n\nIn conclusion People should take other peoples guidance from experts and authorities about matters due to people needing a little more help, telling them stories about the past so they dont go through that rough past and make the same mistakes. All im trying to say is that in my opinion is that you should always take someone else decision because maybe it will help other people in the long run. I'm just gonna be a lawn mower, a person who just cuts grass for living. I agree that some people may not what to interact with other people or even care about what they want to say. Has it ever crossed your mind that people today are struggling to make their own decisions, and wanted feedback from other people and just maybe wanted to change their mind. Teens need to focus on what is right for them making better decisions, like not to drink, help mom out in the kitchen, and do something productive. I've had so many people bring me down on how I'am going to never make it the Army branch. I agree but if you just hear them out they might just convince you to change your mind",

The best example is the one student in class got an highest score test, the others will do whatever it takes to get higher that score was. The experiences is the knowledge or skill gather from the pass; the inspiration is person with confidence and desire to do something that makes the the other people follow. In the other side, it has a limited things become disadvantage for students who taking classes at home such as communication to solve the problems, competition each other and experiences inspiration from teachers. Those are the most important things school offer to students. Instead of video conferencing, school offers to students time to see teacher, professor to discuss their problems and find out what they were struggling with. Distance learning was popular, and had so many students and parents chose instead of attend in class. It is convenient and highly support for students in many different way.

The reason of that is because nowadays theirs youtube and most of the people have phones computers and TV's and so people can go learn stuff from phones,computers,and tv.

As students are inundated with extracurricular activities and overwhelming expectations, it is essential that their academic learning should not be hindered by undue pressures. \n\nIn recent years, celebrities such as Eminem have gained recognition for their similar educational paths. \n\nHaving shorter school time is important to ensure students are given the time and space to flourish both academically and socially, particularly in an era when academic pressure is at an all-time high",
      "instructions": "Task: Research the benefits of shorter school time for students and explain reasons why having shorter school time would be beneficial. Analyze the argument of those who disagree with having shorter school time and explain why their argument is not as persuasive. Compare and contrast the educational path that celebrities such as Eminem took and consider the benefits and drawbacks of pursuing that route. Lastly, explain the importance of having shorter school time and why it should be considered fair."

Also, if you try your best in a problem then, when you have the same problem you will know how to solve it. Finally, it is important to do your best in a situation because it would make you improve yourself from your mistakes.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree with this quote because you should always try to do your best in a problem. Also, if you try to solve a problem then you will learn from your mistakes and wouldn't commit the same mistake twice. First, if you don't try to solve a problem then it will come back in to your life and you will have to deal with it again. First example, is about my younger brother who didn't try on a test and got a bad grade which made him retake the test. One example, is about my brother he did his best on a test and got a 82 percent now he knows he has to improve in that subject.      . One example, of this is about my cousin he could have been playing professional soccer but he didn't try his best on the tryout which made him not make the team. First, if you try your best in a situation you can learn on what to improve on. Overall, If you don't do your best you will not learn and improve from a situation.\n\nAnother reason, I agree with this statement is because if you don't try your best in a situation then you will end up back in the same hole. One reason, is if you don't try to do your best in a situation you could end up regretting your decision. Finally, if there is a problem it's also chance for you to show others what you can do. Also, a chance to do your best to fix a problem could be a one time opportunity. Another reason, is if you try do your best in a situation you could end up learning something new. Then, you could learn ways to improve on, to help you solve the problem. First, you wouldn't regret at least trying to solve a problem. Another example, is when one of my friend's brother did his best in a race and lost which made him train more and harder to improve his speed. When you have a problem do you think to yourself, how can I do my best to fix this problem? American jazz legend Duke Ellington said,\"A problem is a chance for you to do your best.\" In my opinion, I agree with Duke Ellington's quote. Lastly, if you don't put any effort try to resolve a problem you could end up back in that hole.\n\nI agree with this quote because if you don't try to do your best in a situation you could end up regretting your decision. Lastly, if you don't do your best in a situation it could affect your life.\n\nI also agree with this quote because if you try your best in a situation you could end up learning something new",

His relentless dedication paid off in the form of one of most important technological inventions in history. When faced with a difficult situation, our initial reaction is often to give up and accept a subpar solution. During the application process, I kept running into roadblocks. With determination and a lot of hard work, nearly any challenge can be overcome. But by refusing to accept anything less than our best effort, we open ourselves up to possibilities we hadn\u2019t considered. \n\nTake, for instance, the famous story of Thomas Edison\u2019s invention of the light bulb. But instead of giving up, I persevered until I found a solution. It felt like I was up against an insurmountable task. It\u2019s a remarkable example of the power of persistence and of doing your best to solve a problem no matter how challenging.\n\nI experienced this firsthand when I was applying to college. Despite failing thousands of times to make a functioning bulb, Edison kept pushing himself to create something that worked. So the next time you find yourself facing an obstacle, remember to stay committed and never stop striving for the best.. \nWhen it comes to problem-solving, there is no substitute for doing your best",

Dear Principal:\n\nI think students must have a least a B average to participate in sports. A lot of students would want to bring their grades up because they would like to participate in sports. That way the students can bring their grades up. Maybe the students can bring their grade up and that way the students can work harder in class.\n\nThat way students can work hard and participate in a sport that they deserve for getting good grades. One way they can bring up their up and be able to participate in sports is by turning in there homework and completing their work in class.\n\nHere at SCHOOL_NAME we have a policy that says \" If you have more than three (F)'s you cant participate in a sport\". That's a way students can bring up their grades. This policy may work so students can bring their grade up and stop failing their classes.

Lower-income students, students with English as a second language, or students with learning disabilities or other special needs may struggle to meet these standards, putting them at a significant disadvantage as far as participation in school sports is concerned. \nIn summary, due to a growing awareness of students\u2019 academic performance and the increasing necessity for them to reach a certain level of academic achievement, many schools have implemented policies that require students to obtain a certain grade average to be eligible to participate in sports.\n\nThe primary benefit of these policies is that it encourages students to strive for higher academic achievement while in school, as grades are an important factor both in eligibility to participate in sports and further educational opportunities like college and technical training. In addition, some have criticized the policies for stigmatizing students who don\u2019t reach the grade average, creating a potentially negative atmosphere in the school.",

For example: if you neighbor look it you clean you yard or your house or helping others neighbors, like cut the grass and help each other you can be motivation for other person, thats how complete your accomplishment of be inspiration for other person.\n\nLast being yourself is important because your accomplishment can change the mentality of others, than the people see it your progressive on your life doing thing the other people ask them self, how they did it?, you can leave a massage and tell them how you did it , and if you did it they can do it too. For example: in the family always we can see different type of family, one they have job but with lower salary, and one with their own company, if we are the type of person like to help your own family you gonna transmit that like good vibes, hope, etc.\n\nIn conclusion, like the author said is constantly we like a humans trying to do extra things to have a great result and accomplishment in the life, and more then 50 percent of the world do that because the majory of the person see the benefits of help to others, and the most important the world see a positive side of this massege that the author said always do something else and our greatest accomplishment can be example for another person around of us because more than example we can be inspiration for many people in the world.. I am agrees because when being yourself the people see something special on you and try to be a person you like to learn new things maybe in the first try thats no gonna be perfect but you never give up to be different around a lot of person. Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote \"To be yourself in the world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.\" Currently your accomplishments, acts, and attitude speak of you and how great you are, around the world many of the people think do something else is a act of a humble person for example: on your career, your area of work, in the school you do something it's not your responsibility,the people gesture the big heart has and how important it is show to the world you trying make something else to dial the different",

By being yourself and embodying certain values, you can show others that it is possible to make a difference. You can also inspire others to become advocates for change. By forging these connections, individuals can create a strong support system where everyone can be open and honest with each other. \n\nAnother positive effect of being yourself is that it can help create positive change in the world. When individuals embrace their own values, passions, dreams, and goals, they create an example for others to follow and an inspiration for change. Therefore, it is important to embrace your individuality and use it to uplift those around you.. For example, if you share your own passions and dreams with others, others may be inspired by your drive and commitment. This connection can lead to collaboration on projects and help create opportunities in the community. Being yourself can show others that it is ok to be unique and different from the status quo, and to be proud of their individuality.\n\nOne positive effect of being yourself is that it can create connections with people. This can raise awareness of social issues and problems, and can mobilize positive action for change. By sharing your individuality with others, you can create connections and foster a supportive community. \nBeing oneself is an extremely important part of life, as it is the only way to truly express who you are and make a positive impact on those around you",

That way when people return to school others wont be so behind on things and can remember the objectives taught. Why should educators feel that a longer winter break than summer could help retain information?\n\nIn my point of view having a longer winter break would not be enjoyable students like the fact that they can be able to enjoy their break. A longer winter break could possibly help the scholar remember what was learned, if they were to revise and analyze work that was given to in the past in this situation.\n\nIn conclusion changing the season would not help students retain information and is not a good idea , unless the individual were to spend time studying a few times out of the break. Whats a break if you cannot enjoy it?\n\nIn addition what maybe the students can take into consideration is to review some of the things learned, during the free time on their break. Changing the season of the break would not be enjoyable either cause of cold weather, it would certainly not help students to remember the information they learned when they were in school. Even though students cannot retain information on learning targets, at least it wont waste time because having a longer winter than summer would extend time causing time to be lost in the school year. Making winter break longer than summer and a week off in spring and fall is not a good idea.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 .

They might add a day to the week end which would be more days per week end that sounds good to me. Most likely be that people will get tired really fast. If a lot of people agrees you might get this to happen in you school. You learn a lot more thing for next year which is really help full for the next year of classes you have. What if your school wanted to add one hours and a half would you agree or disagree? I presently think that no one would like that like dont like that idea at all and let me tell you why I would int like that. If you want it to happen in your school then do it.    . First if you dont like school that much like me you would do what ever you can to stop that. Well then if they ask you to do that then you know that you have to ask every one in the school to sign the paper if you really don't want this to happen. Finally you simply like school you like seeing friends in school and you like learning more things.\n\nHow you may be able to stop it? will first you have to go to your principle and him/her how you can you stop this form going on well they might say get a exact amount of people to sign a paper. If you want this to happen then ask your principal if this can happen in any way. Finally not that much people would come to school they would not like it even more.\n\nSome ways you might like this is that. However there is going to be some one to not like you idea and they might go wrong for you but I think you can get this.\n\nSo now that you know how to do this it say do it.

Another thing that they can do is add lease day to the school year I think that people would really like that and other ways are.

Well like the other one go to your principle and ask them if they can add another hour and a half but and another day to your week end or less day of the school year.

Even some want to join the work force to earn money for college or help their families financial problems.\n\nLastly some students have almost all credits to graduate due to taking high school classes at an earlier level.

Students will start texting instead of doing their assigned work the teacher gave them. They will start using their phones for other purposes that are not educational or what their teacher has recommended. Students will start thinking it is okay for them to take out their phones when it is time for learning.\n\nSecond reason i believe it is wrong for students to have cell phones in classroom. Students will not have the chance to learn how it use to be. When teachers do hands on work during class students can learn and teach their peers.\n\nLast reason why i believe students should not have phones during class is ,phones are a privileged to have. I believe schools should not allow students to use their phones during class.        . Teachers should not allow phones during class time because students will not know when is the right time to have phones during class. Students that actually take notes have a better chance to memorize what they learned and doing better in tests.

Furthermore, having confidential student information accessible on phones can reduce student-teacher trust and engagement in the learning process. For instance, mobile phones can help teachers easily manage class assignments, store student grades, and create collaborative learning opportunities. \n\nThe use of mobile phones in classrooms for educational purposes is a topic that has received much attention in recent years. \n\nIn conclusion, allowing phones in the classroom can have a negative impact on student learning. On the other hand, opponents of phones in classrooms contend that they can negatively affect student learning by becoming a distraction and monitor students\u2019 academic performance. Research has shown that the mere presence of mobile phones in the classroom can create an atmosphere of distraction, and divert attention away from course material. \n\nSome major arguments against having students use their phones in the classroom are that mobile phones can significantly reduce the amount of time spent on academic tasks, impede students\u2019 ability to engage with course material, and reduce students\u2019 respect for their instructors.

Both options have a good opportunity to be in a good university. Plus, you have better opportunities and also you don't waste your time.\n\nEven four years is not a bad idea because you do more and you learn more and you can get more information. Before you finish high school, before you get in the college and you do not finish the university to old. For example: sports, clubs and help the teachers. Three years of high school is a challenge. You have the same facilities even if you finish early or you take more time. The majority of the people when is young always think about that they leave school because they don't want to end when they get old. High school is an important and necessary step to get to the successful, is a requirement in life because of the education and the things that you should learn. The student have to be after school and take classes during summer is a lot of stress and a lot of things to do, but is not impossible. In four years the student learn more, but I don't think is necessary to be in the school all that time. It's better 3 years than 4 because, you get a job, you get on the college earlier and you accomplish your goals before what you expect.\n\nMost of the kids are looking for end the school early, is a good motivation for the students that they will end the school early. Four years is a good option, but three years or less sound better. It just depends on what the student wants to do and what decision it will make. . high school is hard but not impossible to finish, and is a good idea to push the students to graduate before, there are better opportunities and the only thing that I think when someone is telling me that I have to be more time in the school is \"I'll be old when I'll finish the school\" and that doesn't sound good. That's why I like the idea. In that way maybe the majority of the teenagers will be more focus on what they are doing, and have a better future. Is it a good idea to finish high school in three years than four years?\n\nFour years is to long to graduate from high school. In four years you do a lot of things you can participate in many activities. Four years Is good but not all the students like to do the same thing in that time and they get bored. If the student want to success in life it doesn't matter how much time it will take the only thing that is important is to accomplish the goals.\n\nI am agree with the idea to finish high school in 3 years, I think that 3 years are enough for the student to learn all the stuff that needs",

On the other hand, taking four years to finish allows for a less stressful academic load as well as more time to participate in extracurriculars and develop important social skills.. \n\nHowever, going through high school in three years can be more stressful and demanding for the student, as more courses will need to be taken in the same amount of time while still leaving time for homework and studying. Finishing high school in three years may provide a head start but it also requires a great deal of discipline and hard work. While the four year timeline gives students the opportunity to take part in a more extensive extracurricular curriculum -- such as more elective classes, sports, and school clubs -- graduating in three years can provide a chance to speed up the process and get a head start on college or a career. In addition, there is less time available to form relationships with classmates, participate in extracurriculars, and develop other important social skills",

There are many reasons to have someone make decisions for you it would be much less stressful and you would have less chance of failing, but everyone need to grow up at some point and do what is best for them, You can't live under someone your whole life at some point you will be on your own.\n\nThose are the reasons I believe everyone should make there own decisions in the long run you will be 10 times the person if you trust your-self and do it your way. A person should never put there life in the hand of anyone but them-self. this left Generic_Name with not that many friends and he is sad and deperested today.\n\nMaking your own decisions all the time can be hard and at some point you may fail but if you keep trying you can make it big one day. This shows how important it is to trust your self even if no one agrees with you.\n\nPeople will say that someone with more life experious will help others more then they can help them-self but they can make it so much further then others. Self-reliance is better then hoping someone makes the best decisions for you. If he had chose to be a doctor he would be in school still and never meet his wife. This is because people need to follow there own instincts in life no one knows them like they do and what is best for them. If someone stops talking to you because they dont like a decision you make and did't do what they said to do then they don't deserve to be in your life.. Why would anyone want someone to make decisions for them, People will always want what is best for them so if people trust someone to pick a important life decision what if they pick something that will help them in there long run and not you.\n\nMy older brother 5 years ago was done with school and was planning his career he wanted to be a engineer but my mom and dad wanted him to be doctor; He made his own decision at the end and now lives his best life with a kid and wife.

Having a mentor that we can look up to and depend on can be incredibly beneficial, but it also important to trust in our own judgment and rely on ourselves when making decisions. This example serves to show that when we depend on someone else to make decisions for us, we can be taking away the chance to make our own mistakes and learn from them. It not only helps steer us in the right direction as an individual, but also allows us to have more freedom and independence. Generic_Name relied heavily on someone else to make decisions for them, and in the end faced dire consequences. Without having a role model in life, it can be difficult to find success.

One month is not enough time and not fair when us students go 10 months straight to school, two months and couple days is a good amount of time to relax.\n\nAlso when it is summer there are plenty of activities to do like go to national parks, amusement parks, water parks, play outdoor sports, have gatherings with family members, and relax at home. There should not be a week break in fall, because first there are no special holidays or reason why we should have week off, also if no school for a whole week and Columbus Day people will start to get the habit not to come to school. Finally it might seem that most students will forget information during the summer, it will not matter because the student will not be learning the same information as last year.. When visitng family you need time to be with them and enjoy time with them, because you wont get to see them often when you leave.

      "human_text": "For example: Generic_Name, a student from my class, he usually absents from school, since the school change the schedule, he started to go to school more often, but he did not study, he went around and talked what he did in the last three-day weekend, his grade was bad, but he did not care.\n\nIn conclusion, some businesses have adopted a four-day work week to conserve energy and resources, but the school does not have to because school is where people come and learn new world, to explore more what are we capable and able to do, we are not wasting the resources, so why we have to adopt four-day school week? Please write a letter to the local government of the city to change the schedule of our school. We are not using resources to waste, we are using resources to make a key to open the \"Success Gate\" leads to the bright future for our generation and the next America's generations.. My friend, Generic_Name, is a very good student, he will not go to bed unless he finishes his homework. Changing from five-day school week to four-day school week has lots of disadvantages, mainly these three reasons: students do not have time to do more works, students move to other school due to the pressure of homework at school tend to rises, and students do not focus on learning because of three-day weekend.\n\nTo start with, students do not have time to do more works. For example: before the school change the schedule, I have a whole day to review my works to do the test, now I have to rush off my feet to review my works and that make me completely exhausted. His parent decided to move him to another school. However, because the school has changed the system from five-day school week to four-day school week, he had to do more works than usual. let say that if we have an extra day to review all works that we done to prepare for the test on the next day, it would done well than when we just have more few minutes. He cannot sleep for a few days, he did not done all his works, and his grades tend to be bad. Whenever the test would start on Monday, the students will have three-day weekend to do so, that is a completely waste of time.\n\nTo continue, students move to other school due to the pressure of homework at school tend to rises. For example: My friends, Generic_Name and Generic_Name, they are good students, but because their homework is too much, they could not done all homework, they had to stop all the club activities to catch up their classes, their grades went bad, so their parents decided to move them to other school to help them study easier.\n\nSome people believe that the school has four-day school week is better because they can have more time to learn and relax, they are wrong because having four-day school week make their time rush and their have to run to catch up the schedule.\n\nAnd the last, students do not focus on learning because of three-day weekend",
      "ai_text": "\n\nThis year\u2019s final exams have shown us how the five-day school week motivates students to become more prepared for the assessments and can help them be ready for the future. Furthermore, the truncated amount of time available for learning and growth will reduce the quality of education that the students witness in their respective disciplines.\n\nA four-day school week will also cause undue stress and pressure on students, as all their lessons will be crammed into four days rather than five, making it hard for them to take a break from the workload. Additionally, with the three-day weekend, students may become lethargic and unenthusiastic in learning and developing skills, and gradually become less productive. \n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]. \n\nFor all these reasons, I urge you not to adopt a four-day work week and to maintain the five-day school week for better academic achievements and continuity. \n    \nDear Local Government,\n\nI am writing to express my strong objections to the proposal of changing the school system from a five-day to a four-day workweek. \n\nFirstly, the lack of an extra day will drastically cut down the amount of time in the day for students to do their work, test their skills during extracurricular activities, and participate in other academic engagements, making it nearly impossible for them to establish a balance between leisurely activities and extracurricular activities. Without this extra day, it is likely that student achievement will go down. It is my belief that this will prove to be damaging in a multitude of ways",

I know its hard for everyone to find a ride to school or maybe it isn't, but say one day you move and u can't find a ride to school the next week and you dont have a ride cause your parents can't take you cause they're running late for work, or you just missed the bus and your house is to far from the school. My third opinion would be why not try it you know maybe you'll like it.\n\n1 OPINION: Everyone one knows school is very hard for everyone, nowadays school is based off of how you dress, or the way you walk, or just in general who you are. It was a good switch for me, and it'll be a good switch for you too!\n\n2 OPINION: Every where you live there is always one problem, school range. The price for online school is around from 150-200 dollars, I know it might sound a little exspensive but its worth every penny you spend. My first opinion on distance learning would be, maybe he or she gets bullied for the classes they take and dont want to be in school no more. Would you take it ? I would because iw ouldn't have to stress on trying to get up on time, and trying on clothes for school, or finding something to eat all in a rush. Hello my name is Generic_Name and I am here to tell you why I think, distance learning is a good idea, rather then a bad idea. Well that's why you've been given the option for online school. So dont hesitate to call, call right now if you can I love it and they will to.. I will be giving you three diffrent points of view, and why it wouldn't be a bad idea for some of us. My second opinion would be if your not in school range and your parents can't drive you to school on time, then you could easily stay home, pull out your phone, computer, or tablet and do you work on it. So think about it for a minute and see why it might be a good option for you.\n\n3 OPINION: Why not just try it. I think you guys or girls, or whatever should give it a try because not everyone has the privilege to have sort of secondary learning challenge I think that if your try it just like I did. Also you can start your assignments on your time, say like your not busy u can start it then but you have to do them because there are new assignments everyday. So dont hesitate to try it you'll love it.\n\nIn conclusion I think it is a good thing to do distance school because it gives you benefits you've never gotten before and it might turn out to be the best decision you ever made in your son, or daughter life. I love online school cause i can get up at whatever time i want to. I used to get bullied in school a lot but ever since I switched to online school I've never felt better I get all my work done, the teachers are so nice to me, there very patient and polite, and I dont have to put up with nobody's crap from school",

It is an innovative and growing form of education that can provide several benefits over traditional learning. It can provide safety and flexibility to those who are being bullied and those who have limited access to a brick and mortar school. With the variety of benefits distance learning offers, it's worth considering as a viable option.. \n\nFor students who are being bullied at school, distance learning can provide a sense of security and peace of mind.

Although there are costs associated with distance learning, when comparing to the cost of attending a traditional institution, it may be less expensive in the long run. \nDistance education is, without a doubt, a great opportunity for students who are looking for an alternative to traditional learning.

By establishing these strategies, educators can head off potential issues that might arise from allowing students access to their cellphones while in class.. On the other hand, it is important to consider the potential for cellphones to be distracting, and they may even create an atmosphere of inequity, as some students may not have access to a smartphone or reliable internet connection. On one hand, cellphones can have a positive effect on the learning environment by providing students with instant access to information, the ability to collaborate with their peers on projects, and tools to increase their organization and productivity. \nCellphones are a pervasive technology in our lives today, and new conversations are emerging around their use in the school setting",

The more things you learn the more prepared you will be in your life.\n\nMy first reason that support my response, is that if you don't keep trying to do better everyday, you are not going to complete your goal. If you work on something that you have already work on it, and you don't stop focused on it will make your life easier. Every time you try to improve, its a good opportunity for you to grow. For example, some people have their goals but they don't try their best.\n\nMy second reason that support my response is that when you have the experience on doing something you most keep doing it, and you will improve each day. If you keep trying your best and doing what you like to do you will grow each day. If you focused on doing good everyday you will grow. The more you work on something the fastest you will see the different in your life. Everyday you most have the purpose of learning new things. The more you know about something, the best future you will have. The experience you have will make your future better. Learning new things each day, makes a person specialized and all the things you know. If you try to learn more things and not just stay focused in just one thing will make you to be able to grow. \"Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow\".\n\nIn my opinion, I agree with this quote because, if you do not try to do better everyday, you are not going to reach your purpose. Working on your purpose will make you have a better life.. When you have the experience, on doing something you have to keep doing it, and you will improve each day. For example, in my experience when I try to learn more about something, its easier for me to talk about it.\n\nTo conclude, I agree with the author Ralph Waldo Emerson's statement. Its important that you try your best everyday not only you will grow in your life but you are going to make yourself proud as well. If you keep working on something that you have already work on it, and you don't stop focused on, it will make you grow.

Even today, entrepreneurs and innovators rely on creative and ambitious risk-taking in order to create businesses, products, and services that solve problems and advance society.\n\nAdditionally, there are countless personal success stories of people who took the step to try something new and it changed their lives. Most of us can look at our own lives and recognize the same kind of successes \u2013 be it large or small \u2013 that have come from pushing ourselves to do something beyond our current level.\n\nIn conclusion, this quote succinctly captures the vital role that striving to accomplish something new and challenging plays in our growth. It is only when we are willing to take risks and learn new things that we can truly expand our capabilities and reach new heights.. The quote, \"Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow,\" is a great reminder of how important it is to step out of our comfort zone and take risks in order to progress.\n\nThe greatest accomplishments of humanity have come as a result of pushing our boundaries and trying to do something new and challenging.

That's my first reason why we shouldn't attend school from home.\n\nMy second reason why students shouldn't attend classes from home is because some studennts can cheat on a test or quiz while they are at home. What if a student gets sick at home ? they won't do the work that is due while they are at home, some while take like the whole week off and not do anything at all. I strongly disagree with this because some students would not attend the classes from home, some students can cheat on a test or quiz while they are at home, and the final reason is that this can make teachers lose their jobs as teaching and make some students drop out of school.\n\nMany people believe that learning at home by a way of online or video conferencing is a great idea to attend classes from home. For example, students can wake up late for these online classes and forget about them throughout the whole day. I say this because they will use the internet or a textbook because they know that there's no teacher watching them cheat on the test or quiz while they are at home taking it. That's my final reason why students shouldn't attend classes from home.\n\nIn conclusion, some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. For example, students can search up the answers on online or use textbooks to help them out at home. Another example is, some students can just drop out of school while they do this at home. That's my second reason why we shouldn't attend school from home.\n\nMy final reason why students shuldn't attend classes from home is because this can make teachers lose their jobs as teaching and make some students to drop out of school. Students always find a way to cheat and plus if they take a test or a quiz at home, they are for sure going to cheat on it because they know that there isn't any teachers telling them to put their phones away or notes. So in my case you should talk with your principle about this offer, unless there's a sicknees happening throughout the world and it's making school to shut down and do online classes. This puts teachers in a bad situtation because that means they are not doing well while they are teaching online or video conferencing. Should we as students learn from home or school ?. For example, what if students don't attend their classes at home and also what if the ones that actually do their work do bad on it ?. For example, if they don't do any work at home they might just drop out of school without telling anyone. I strongly disagree because some students would not attend the classes from home, some students will cheat on a test or quiz while they are home, and the final reason is that this can make teachers lose their jobs as teaching and make some students to drop out of school.                           . In another case students won't do anything at home because they are at home relax and doing nothing but, just watching tv and playing video games. In my opinion, It's a bad idea because some students would not attend their classes from home. Teachers can be balme for this because the way they teach it throughout online or video conferencing",

While remote learning can offer an accessible and flexible learning experience, it can also have adverse effects on student attendance and cheating. This can result in low levels of engagement, and may lead to poor learning outcomes. \nDistance learning has become a popular option for many students, and with it, certain risks and benefits arise. \n\nAll in all, while there are risk associated with distance learning, there are also many positive aspects, such as enhanced access to education for students who may otherwise struggle to attend school. To counteract this, teachers must find innovative solutions to ensure that students do not take advantage of online learning.\n\nDistance learning can also have an impact on teachers' jobs, as they may feel overworked or lack the freedom to instruct classes in their usual manner. However, when adapted properly, remote learning can be an effective method of teaching that can benefit both teachers and students.\n\nThe potential of students dropping out of school while learning from home is also a concern. Without regular attendance or in-person supervision, more students may remain long-term absent from school, impeding their learning progress. Governance must be implemented to ensure distance learning is effective but not abused. With the right strategies in place, distance learning can be a safe and beneficial educational system.. \n\nWhen it comes to attendance, many students may find themselves less inclined to actively participate in classes due to lack of in-person interaction",

I myself have witnessed someone with a good attitude it was my good old friend he was having a good attitude all day,But than someone in his family passed away he was really sad about it. There are so many things that can make good deed too someone with a good attitude even you can make yourself happy, But sometimes its hard to keep a good attitude while its a difficult time. My friend was so tired that he wanted to take a break but his dad didnt let him he kept telling him get up lets go play everyday and on weekend his dad woke him up at 5 in the morning to go play soccer. Even in a bad times like for example if a family member or a friend is sick you can make there day by getting them there favorite food or snack that can get them in a good attitude with you because they may be a little grumpy while there sick.\n\nWhile your in a good attitude you'll feel like you accomplish something for today and while other people will try to take you down you mind and your feeling will be strong and you won't be able to be in a bad attitude. Everyone thought he was mad at something little like him not getting a toy or something because he was just a 10yr boy the rest of the family thought he was just a regular little kid running around all over the place laughing at everything and even cry at little stuff, but no he did nun of that all he did was just stay in his room lights turned off and the door was shut and locked. But than one day he forgot to lock his room and than I walked in and he was just crying and kept saying \"I got nobody I got nobody\" and than i made him feel better and then we put him in counseling for a few months and he started getting better and better while time went on.\n\nWhen you have a good attitude it can make your day be good and you'll be positive with everything. The day they took her to the hospital has got a heart attack at the night she was there and when she was there for a few days and than they brought her back home and that same night she got a heart attack again and my friends dad just said she can't leave the hospital or she might die if we take her back a few weeks passed and his mom recovered and now they are a happy family.\n\nI have witnessed my family member have a good attitude even during a difficult time. Than on Monday when he got back to school he started getting eye bags under his eyes and than he was tired of it and went o his dad and i said '' Im tired of soccer and i give up''. Than his attitude was going bad I tired to make his day get better to go and get ice cream but than he was up for it so I was in a good attitude so was he so we were happy, But than his mom got really sick and the doctors said that she might not make it and than he shaded tears and than his day was just going horrible. I wish everyone in the world can be happy and something they did and not be mad at everything like sometimes when you play sports when you lose its a little upsetting at first but than you lose your attitude get stronger and you start being your self way more.\n\nI witnessed another of my friends trying to keep a good attitude his attitude was getting stronger and better because he played a lot of soccer but than his dad kept taking it to seriously. Most people would want to be be in a good attitude but others are the world should just be happy and not always mad at something. One of my family members were going though depression but no one else knew because everyday he always looked happy there was always a smile on his face when someone saw him there was not a time he looked upset or sad but just happy all the time. So much was going on with his family like his mom is so sick she can barley move she was taken to the hospital because she had a high fever of 103. His dad looked so shocked and upset that he left him speechless and than he said fine when you grow up you are not going to become a famous soccer player. No one knew what he was going through they didnt know he was getting bullied,failing his classes and last of all no friends he thought he had no one and he kept telling himself he was alone",

Taking classes from home can also lead to feeling isolated from classmates, which can make it more difficult to engage with the material.

On the one hand, students taking classes at home can enjoy the benefits of being able to set their own schedule and being able to work at their own pace. It is important for students to weigh their options when considering which route to take. They can access resources more easily, as many online courses provide access to academic materials and other resources. Additionally, online courses require more self-discipline and can be more difficult for students who learn better in a traditional classroom setting. Additionally, online courses have lower tuition and provide an easier learning process. \n\nOverall, there are advantages and drawbacks of taking classes at home versus in school",

Another benefit of being home school is that you dont have to wake up early in the morning to go to school, you don't have to miss the bus anymore, don't have to worry about sports, staying after school, basically you have freedom to do more stuff, a lot of people in high school dont have time to go out or have som fun, not many kids are able to go out becasues their parents are strict and dont let them out but that's besides the point, many kids take avantange of home school some of those kids, they have parents that travel around the world and they dont have a chance to sit down and talk about what is going on in school or the everyday life, their parents will take their kids with them becasue they dont want their kids to be home alone, instead they take the kids with thme so they don't have to miis out on their aventues, and a lot of these kids are very talented and ready for the out side world becasue their education was high quiality and always on point. Another benefit of being home school is that you never have to worry about school shooters bad people in school, getting abues in school, not dealing with any problems with other students. Yes, I do agree, because it's a great way of learning because we don't have to deal with other kids in school, we're save because we are home, we don't have to worry about going out to the dangerous world that we in now. For example I have friends that do school at home and they are just like regular kids from High School, a lot of people would say that being home school its like going to prison but it's not, home school just gives us a better way of learning at home with no one to bother",
      "ai_text": "Additionally, home schooling allows parents to accommodate their children's unique interests and provide advanced instruction in topics of their interest. Home schooling gives students the freedom to decide when and where they want to work, making it easier for them to choose hands-on and out-of-the-classroom activities. Both methods of education have their own unique advantages, and choosing which one is right for your specific situation can be a difficult decision. So, what exactly are the benefits of home schooling when compared to traditional schooling?\n\nOne of the most obvious benefits of home schooling is customization. \n\nAnother major benefit of home schooling is the freedom for learners to work at their own pace. However, home schooling allows students to slow down and take their time in understanding a concept or to skip ahead if they already possess any prior knowledge. Home schooling allows learners the freedom to customize their own unique learning experience and create a more personalized educational setting.. \n\nAlthough both traditional school and home schooling have their advantages, those who opt for home schooling are able to take advantage of more individualized and flexible instruction. Home schooling allows parents to build a lesson plan that caters to not only their child's strengths, but also focuses on areas that their child needs help with. \n\nFinally, home schooling provides learners with a more flexible schedule and the option to structure learning around other activities. While in traditional school classrooms, teachers are limited to an average set pace that does not cater to students with different learning styles. \nIn recent years, the debate between home schooling versus attending a traditional school has become increasingly prevalent. Parents who choose this option are able to tailor their children's curriculum to fit their individual needs and abilities",

Also some students might want to spend more time with there grandparents because they might not be able to see them or they either want to spend more time with there grandparents because they want to help them out side there in the stages of being old so they might need help with something. Some students might have to go straight home because they might have to go babysit their little siblings since there parents are working. Also some students have to go home early and do something else instead of doing their school work and some students have to enjoy their free time instead of working all day.\n\nSome students decide they want to spend sometime with their family. For example when I get out of school I usually have to go home and take care of my little sister because my mom can't .\n\nI wouldn't like to be stuck in school for another two more hours because I would have to be leaving school late and if I had a four day work week I would not be able to do my school work at home , When I would get home from work I would be really tired and just decide to fall asleep.. Instead of doing their school work some students have to go after school to go sports so they might not have time to stay in school for 10 hours because they might have to be going to their practice whens school finishes. Also I feel like some people might just be getting tired of all the work they give us to the point were some students might just give up on there work. Would you wanna be extending 2 more hour to your school schedule because you work for four days for 10 hours? In my opinion I feel like no because sometimes some students decide they want to spend some time with their family . Some students decide that because sometimes they might not have enough time with some one that lives far from them so they decide they want to go where they live and they want to be with them before they leave. Students usually have to go do something else instead of having to go do their school work all day.\n\nSome students have to enjoy their free time instead of working all day. Some students might want to go out and go shopping .Some student decide to go out and spend some time with their parents since they don't have that much time .Also some student just want to enjoy the only time they are free to do something instead of being stuck at school all day or being stuck at work all day.\n\nIn my opinion I feel like we shouldn't add more hours to out school schedule because at this time we are still young and we want to enjoy the free time that we have before we get older because then we won't be having that much time left since we will mostly be in school still or might just be working all day.

      "ai_text": "Not being able to stay for those extra two hours can have both physical and psychological consequences. Having an extra two hours tacked onto the regular school day puts an undue burden on students who may already be lacking in energy or time. \n\nThe lack of time and energy can also have a psychological effect on students. Having a full day of school can take a toll on students\u2019 physical and mental energy, and asking them to stay two additional hours with limited resources can be overwhelming. While it may not seem like much time, it can be the tipping point between feeling exhausted and feeling overwhelmed. If they are not able to stay the extra two hours, they may feel a sense of guilt or disappointment. It can be emotionally challenging for students to leave school in the middle of a lesson and feel like they are letting both themselves and the teacher down. \n\nFor instance, students who are already feeling overwhelmed by academic tasks may reach a breaking point when faced with the option of staying for an additional two hours of school. \nFor many students, staying two extra hours in school is a challenge. \n\nIn conclusion, staying an extra two hours in school can be an incredibly stressful experience for students who may already be feeling overwhelmed or struggling to manage their time and energy. Moreover, staying an extra two hours in school can also make it more difficult for those with after-school commitments to honor outside obligations or just spend time with family.

      "human_text": "We need to spend our times with books and the schhol is the only place where we can learn something and soend times with the books. But if school make this rule for student the student will be happy with this but in future they will understand that how wrong it is to make a school week shorter without getting anything and just stayed at home. But what if they don't have time in class or teacher's don't have time for student's. For example Last week we had an five days off from school and i didn't study in that week and i forgot to complete an project i got bad grades on that class. Whenever he arrived at home from school, the first thing he do is get out his Laptop from his school bag and start playing games with his friends on online group so you can easily estimate that how many school student playing that game on computer and on phones on weekends and on off days. Do we spend that time with our books? the answers is no we cannot spend time with books on weekends. For example deforestation, use of water to make electricity, which can decrease the ammount of aquatic animals and water on the earth. It can develop a big difference in student education. For example when students have an extra time in their classes, they mostly spend it with thier teachers and asking them questions so they can get answers in a specific way. Some buisness have adopted the idea of a four-day work week so they can conserve energy and resources. A four-day school week can make a big difference in student's school life.\n\nAt the end, I would say that if school will follow the model by extending school and a four-day school week. A regular school week is much better than four-day week of school because in a one day we can learn a lot from our teachers at school.\n\nIn this century every single person is using technology. Almost every studnt spend their weekends with their freinds and they dont care about school study. More school holiday's will give more tension to student that's why they didn't study at home and they would like to study at school. So, four-day school week will effect somewhere in student life. Extending the school day two hour and adopted a four-day work week have many disadavtages. Students are using more technolgy than others, spending time on computer and on phones isn't bad thing but you also have to spend some time with other activites like sports, cultural activites. Human damage many nature things while making energy and resources for their daily use. So the Four-day schhol week will not work for the school it may only work for the buisness but not for the school. In a month there are some federal holidays in weekdays, Which make a five- day school week more short. Conserving energy and resources is very benifical for human life and nature. But it doesn't mean that you have to spend you al free time with friends. . If a teacher has a short time to teach soemthing. Students come to school for learning, sometime they get bored from school. But a short week can a put bad impact on their study and their grades will go down. It's better to keep the five-days school week for students goods and for their better education.\n\nEvery student study hard in school to get better grades in all classes. It can put bad impact on students study and on thier grades, they will spend their weekend more with friends not with books, Students may spend their times on computer games and on phones. From more school hours and with regular days student can learn something more and keep their grades up.\n\nThey will spend their more times with books and paying attention on the study not games or electronic. Spending time with friends is a good habbit. Some student's may not get everything in class, and their class performance will go down and it impact on their grades. It's very important for a teacher to spend a time with their students and ask them about their problems in classes, and also for a students it's very important to share their problems with teacher so, they can find a way to solve the problems. For exaample I have a younger who's fourteen year old. Student's always try to learn more from their teachers and do their best in class. It can only happens when student and teacher both have time in class to discuss. what if we have three days off in a week. Playing game on wekends and on holidays can effect you and your studies and gives you a bad grades. But when i have regular week of school i always complete my work first so i can keep my grades up. But children doesn't want to do this and they play games on phones and on computers. A four-day work week can also effect on thier buisness and put them in loss but it depends on them how they manage their work in four days. But Should schools follow this model by extending the school day two hours and make a four day school week? In my opinion school shouldn't follow this model. They will teach in a very fast or a different way to students. i spent my time with my friends and i didn't know the meaning of study in that time that's why i got bad grade in that class. Even we spend our one school holidays with friends and forget about study. so the Four-day week can make a distance between a teacher and a student.\n\nSecond, Friendship is a very important thing in every person life, Friendship with a good friend can tell you the path of your success. It's better to be in school than on computer games, so we can learn something new. student's already have five- day school week which sometime seems very short, when students have lot of work to do and they need more help of teachers",
      "ai_text": "\n\nRecent studies have revealed that the implementation of a four-day work week can increase productivity among workers, reduce employee turnover, and boost morale. The potential outcomes of such a change greatly depend on the capability of technologies to integrate into the learning experience without negatively affecting the quality of education.\n\nThough a four-day school week presents a unique opportunity to students by giving them an extended weekend, there could be risks such as loss of important material due to a compressed learning environment. At the same time, final exams and long-term projects could be challenging due to having only four days to complete them, and a sudden change in routine could pose a barrier to academic success. Without sufficient time allotted to education, schools would be forced to use modern technologies to replace the lessons and activities traditionally conducted throughout a five-day school schedule. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that such a transition to a four-day school week would bring unpredictable impacts on student academic performance and wellbeing. Ultimately, the pros and cons of a five-day school week need to be compared with those of a four-day school week to determine which is the most suitable for students.",

I think this is having a negative effects on people lives, people are getting racket because they used to maney wedsides. We can do alot of things with out it. Kid are also getting into the technology they are losing their childhooh. I think teenager need a limitation of what they doing in the phones. Since wedsides liike Amazon, Ebay, and others came up people atart get all they need from wedside. If you going to buy anything for the internet just make sure the wedside is safes.

      "human_text": "Another example that proves it is better to work on something to accomplish comes from Adidas' quote or saying \"All in or nothing\". After few years playing in his club, its his time to shine to represent Brazil in the world cup. For example, my friend Generic_Name who really dont know how to write a perfect essay but can speak fluent in English. That's why I decided to study hard and make my parents proud again. So, I told him to work with my classmate who is really good in making essay and ask him to teach Generic_Name how to write a perfect essay. This proves that it is better work on something to accomplish like what my friend Generic_Name did he started practicing his weakness and became a good writer. For example, from the movie\n\nPELE\n\nit is about a young boy who dreamed to become a professional football player. He lived in a small house in Brazil and played football with his friends in his neighborhood. However, it is better to work on something because you can practice your weaknesses. Pele was a poor little kid but plays well even he is very short unlike other people in his town. This proves that working on something will help you gain more knowledge in life and dont stop believing in yourself. After a few years he didn't have a job because he was still shocked to what happened to his business. This proves that practicing your weaknesses will make you more a better person.\n\nTo conclude all these statements above, it is better to work on something to accomplish because you will gain more knowledge and people will be proud to what you've accomplished. That's why he was forced to closed his business and rest for a while. When they play against other teams, they always laugh at them because they dont have a proper gear for playing. This proves that you need hard work to accomplish something like Pele he never stop doing what he wanted to be and now people from Brazil and all over the world are proud of him. For instance, that line is very effective to people especially the athletes around the world because doing your goals in life makes you more stronger and better than the others. My dad was a college graduate in the Generic_City, he dreamed to become a successful businessman and he made it. Generic_Name was always shy to read or present his work to our teacher. However, I practiced by myself like what what coach told me. He was really bad in writing essay when we were in middle school. I realized that my friends here are not the same like in the Generic_City that I used to talk to everyday. Unfortunately, my dad's business went down because something happened that he didn't liked. And there is a guy who is recruiting players for their club. This proves that is it better to work on something to accomplish like the owner of Adidas he became famous and rich because he worked hard, focused on his goals.\n\nThe other side will argue it is not better to work on something to accomplish because you will have more time to do what you want or something else. He was so incredible that time no one can stop him and Brazil won the world cup. And my mentality was I should prove my coach that I will be a better football player. Another example that proves it is better to work on something to accomplish is based on my dad's personal experience. When I was playing with my club my coach said my first touch is not really good unlike the other players. And you should give your best all the time and make people proud to what you've done in life. People are robbing and digging all the way to my dad's store every night. Although some might argue it is not better to work on something to accomplish, actually it is better to work on something to accomplish because you will gain more knowledge and people will be proud to what you've accomplished.\n\nOne reason why it is better to work on something to accomplish is because you will gain more knowledge. We people have different purposes in life, we should never be idle in life.. For instance, I've been playing football since 5 years old because my dad is also a football player. Another example that proves that it is better to work on something to accomplish is based on my personal experience. He is now currently working in five star restaurant owned by a rich man in Generic_City. Have you ever accomplished something in your life? Because people nowadays are very lazy and hard headed because they are easily distracted by social media, people around them, and also the society that's why they cannot focus on their goals in life. After taking the culinary, he went to Generic_City to seek new opportunity. The first few months was amazing because his customers was very loyal to him my dad didn't expect that it will happen. This proves that it is better to work on something to accomplish like what my dad did in his life and he changed for a better living.\n\nAnother reason why it is better to work on something to accomplish is because people will be proud to what you've accomplished. I have an five A's in my classes right know and I'm proud because I accomplished something. However, he decided to take culinary class to work again because he wants to help our family and to gain more knowledge about baking. Pele was the youngest player in the club thats why he was treated like a slave. And yes, Thomas Jefferson was right \"Determine never to be idle.. However, when I moved here in America last year things have changed because I'm new here in this country and I dont know anyone. Pele scored a lot of goals and Brazil went to the finals. It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing something.\"\n\nwe should never stop doing something that can benefit us. After a few weeks of learning, Generic_Name improved his writing skills. For instance, based on my personal experience when I was in middle school, I dont do my projects, homework, seat works because I'm too lazy and I just love talking with my friends everyday in our class. My dad started a business near to schools and shops so many people will go to his store",

The most important step is to find an experienced writer and practice your skills. Additionally, you can explore the deeper meaning behind the Adidas phrase, \u201cAll in or Nothing\u201d.

Many parents should give teenagers the opportunity of studying and talk them about how important is to have a good education and let them think about the career that they want at young age.\n\nThe importance of knowing and thinking about the future at young age has been an impact in now days, because in many cases around the world teenagers do not think about their future, they do not care about school, jobs, education, or their family, but in U.S teenagers have many chances of getting a good job and getting a good healthy life and a great education.\n\nTeenagers will have their life set after High School.\n\nTeenagers are going to be an inspiration for others.\n\nThey will have a good job.\n\nEnsuring that students should have their career in mind by the time that they enter to High School for them to learn more and preparing when they get to college and learn much more and be an inspiration for many other teenagers and for others to think of the importance of having a good education and career. . Each Teenager comes with a dream to U.S. Kids at age of 12 of those countries comes with big mentalities with big dreams, that is what helps many teenagers to choose a good career in U.S, at young age they know that they have to make their family proud and be the alpha of the family with a good career. After Middle School and High School students are ready to start college and they should be assuming what is best for them.\n\nIn some parts of the world teenagers do not have the opportunity to go to school, countries that do not have good recursive, for example: Honduras, El Salvador, Guatemala, Africa. Their mentality is improving each day. In High School students are preparing and learning different elements and different skills, however; learning others skills benefit teenagers in their future. In those kind of countries many teenagers do not go to school because they prefer to work beside of going to school, their education is not good enough. For example: They try to look for information, asking people that already have experiences with the career that they are thinking to take. Why? because in many occasions they do not have another choose. How? and Why? because learning different skills prepared teenagers for any jobs or if they have any kind of problem anywhere. While students are in Middle School in 8th grade, they get the opportunity to see many career's and see which one are they planning to take or have an idea of the career. That is why so many people come to U.S. The society in those countries when kids want to go to school their parents don't let them, \"the education here is not going to guide you anywhere\" that is what they said, that is why now days are many terrorism in many countries because parents takes the dreams of their children and through them to the trash. Guiding students for what they like since a young age is an acceptable idea because they learn more and more each day. Also as the population in those countries is increasing day by day is harder to find a job even if you had a good diploma it do not matters. students should have the opportunity to choose their own career, sometimes students are force to take the career that their parents want. because they know that the education that U.S brings them is their future",

While a good education is generally essential for pursuing a successful career, job opportunities with and without a college degree or diploma may vary depending on the region and the resources available. \n\nFor teenagers, it is important to think carefully as they make this decision for themselves. \nAs technology continues to evolve and education systems become more accessible, more and more students face difficult choices when choosing a career. By encouraging open conversations and dialogues, parents can provide valuable support and advice to their children as they enter this critical stage of their lives. This limits young people's opportunities to break out of the cycle of working to make ends meet and prevents them from realizing their true potential. \n\nIt is also important for teenagers to have the right guidance from their parents at a young age. These opportunities can be unique when compared with those in other countries and may provide different paths for teenage students to pursue their passions. It is also worth considering what job opportunities the United States may offer. Ultimately, this will help teenagers make informed and sound decisions, allowing them to identify and pursue a career that is more suited to their interests and goals.. Parents should take the time to listen to their children and understand their aspirations",

Another way is if you need to do technology work need to be done at home you can use a computer and send an email to your teacher without contacting her about it when your done. when you wanna sign up for soccer you can regrister online. One way it can help you is by if you dont know the answers to a homework you can go on a computer or even a phone and look up answers and wedsites of where your answers can be. I also beleive for other people it can help aso for like, work, bank, food and more . So Technology is good for life becuause it can bring posetive effect.. All you have to do is answers qustions put your information and once your done putting your information in you can pay for it and once you pay your coach will get an email that you singed up for his team. Technology for kids is positive when they are younger than 5. These are sum ways technology can have a negative effect on you.\n\nTo me technology has a poseitive effect in my life because I can be able to do more things and not have to worry about and contact people to help me do it. But sometimes they can also be negative things but negative things also happen in life so its okay for that to happen. Letting them use phones and tablets would be good so they can learn how to say , words , letters, numberrs, and learn new things before they go to school and already know a couple things. For example when you wanna order something online you dont have to calll you can just order it online with out contaction anyone.\n\nTechnology can help you in manys ways. When a parent dosent know how to use a phone it can be stressfull for them becuase they wouldnt know what to do unless someone is there to help him and do the things the parent needs to do on the one. To me i see this as a positive effect on people because it can help you succed in school and complete things you need to do as well.\n\nThere are so many other ways technology can help you as well. So that to me is a posetive effect with technology\n\nFor sum people negative effects could also be negative for them also. Also another negative effect is when if you have all work saved in a computer and you get your computer wet and it wont turn on how are you gonna show your boss or teacher your so that would have a big negative effect on the worker",

On the plus side, advancements in technology have enabled us to stay connected with friends and family, improve educational experiences, and boost workplace productivity. And with digital communication tools, workers can collaborate remotely and get more done in less time. With so much information and interaction available online, it can be tough to disconnect. \n\nHowever, technology can also be used to promote positivity and encourage a healthier lifestyle. For example, fitness tracking apps, meditation tools, and virtual self-care activities can help promote mindfulness and emotional wellbeing. We might also find ourselves distracted from our social, work, and educational responsibilities when we're constantly engaging with our devices. \n\nOn the other hand, technology can also disrupt relationships, lead to addiction and mental health issues, and reduce physical activity. In short, technology can have a far-reaching impact on our lives, and it\u2019s important to use it responsibly, with an awareness of its potential pros and cons..

Most students wanna be home school because they either get bullied, tired of getting in trouble, but mostly students these days wanna graduation early.\n\nIf we also had classes at home more kids will be more safer than at school since what's happening right now in 2018. Students could sleep one or two more hours in. Would students benefit from being able to attend classes for home? In my opinion that wouldn't be a good idea but also be a great idea. They won't get much sleep then they will be tired the next morning. That's giving the students time to do there work and to learn whenever. Some students like to be teach in person and if they were at home then they can't learn at all. It will also be a great idea if we could attend classes from school and at home.\n\nIt wouldn't be a good idea because most students wouldn't do anything or make someone else do it. Thank you for reading my paper hopeful you thought about everything and how it could change everyone problem. have a wonderful day!. If we could have classes at home students wouldn't have to worry about sleeping in class and getting yelled at by the teacher. Then school drama wouldn't happen a lot in school if we could just be home. students wouldn't have to deal with getting suspend or expelled because most kids these days get that. some students are just too lazy. If they have a non core class then they can just go to school to take it but most classes you could probably take online.\n\nI hope you think about changing school to allow students to take classes at home, or allowing them to take some at home, or both. School wouldnt have to deal with drugs, gang violence, or anything that's harmful to the school. What about gym and other non core classes? We could have a time when they gotta start there class and if they don't sign in then they get mark absence.

Furthermore, there can be social and psychological issues that arise out of lack of physical contact and face-to-face interaction. \nThe power of technology has revolutionized the way we learn and access education. This shift in the education system brings with it myriad pros and cons that must be considered. With virtual classrooms, it is more difficult to monitor the progress of individual students, as well as for them to access additional resources such as libraries and labs required for more interactive learning. With the emergence of massive open online courses (MOOCs) and virtual classrooms, more and more students are choosing to attend their classes at home. Freed from the need to commute for long hours to school, they can make better use of their time and have more flexibility. \n\nHowever, there are a few drawbacks to this trend as well.

Everybody has different opinions but hearing different opinions from others can help you make a better choice. Another reason why someone might ask multiple for advice is that everybody has different experiences throughout their lifetime and might know more stuff because of those experiences throughout their lifetime. I think you should ask your parents for advice first before you ask anybody else for advice because your parents are the one the ones who raised you and they know what's best for you. For example your parents probably told you when you were little to not to talk to strangers because they know its the best for you. When someone is asking for advice they might talk to more than one person because someone might have better advice than someone else or might have better and more advice than somebody else. People might ask the elderly for advice because their wise and have lived a long life so they might know alot of information to pass on",
      "ai_text": "People often seek out multiple sources of advice when making decisions, because the wisdom and experience of others can often help them arrive at a well-informed and thoughtful conclusion.\n\nFamily members, especially parents, are typically the first people we turn to when making decisions. Their experience working with people of our age group can be very helpful in understanding our perspective and how it affects our decision-making process. This is because our parents\u2019 deep knowledge and understanding of life often proves invaluable for our decision-making process. \n\nAlong with parents, other adults, such as teachers, coaches, and mentors, can also offer invaluable advice. Parents often have a knack for generating ideas and strategies that we may not have previously considered. \nDecisions are an integral part of our lives. As we age, we become increasingly responsible for making these decisions, so it is important to have the right people to consult when determining the best course of action. In addition, talking to peers, elders, and people from different backgrounds can provide us with a variety of perspectives that could provide a better context for us in selecting a course of action. Gathering knowledge and advice from a variety of people can enable us to arrive at more informed decisions that are more likely to produce the best results.. Additionally, they generally have more life experience than us, and can thus point out potential consequences of a decision we hadn\u2019t thought of. \n\nMaking decisions can be a daunting task, but having a variety of sources to help guide us can be a tremendous help",

If they want to get to know you they will.\n\nConclusion, First impressions are not important things will go wrong sometimes and that's okay. Everyone has very different personalities or ways of being. But one day a new student comes to your school and you introduce yourself but right out of the bat they don't like you without knowing anything about you.

That's when first impressions come to play. When you are on a stated of mind of anger, you could do something drastic but that doesn't defined who you are on your heart and mind. They could think they way you talk, eat, and act is weird because you are trying way to hard for it to not go bad and sometimes that comes out as bad. A lot of people care about their reputation a lot. But it isn't impossible if that person wanted to get to know you they could but they don't want to and yes there's people like that all over the world. You are human and you make mistakes sometimes. Different things we do that others don't and some people may think its weird or we are weird to do that. Every human is not alike in any way possible, all of us are unique in our own way.

That thought could eat you up for the rest of the time, and you try and try to get that person to like you but they don't.

BEING YOURSELF.\n\nBeing yourself is by far the most fulfilling accomplishment any individual would have ever made. They might have some things in common which draws them closer to the idea of being just like them. Little do they know that them turning out exactly just like their role models is almost impossible because they lack their unique personality traits and acquire their own completely different set of traits which makes them who they are.\n\nThe sooner people realize that each individual is unique in one way or another the better. Ideas lead to actions and by visualizing yourself doing things correctly but in your own way is killing two birds with one stone! Author Waldo Emerson was right about being yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else being the greatest accomplishment. Not only does it take a lot of confidence, devotion, and self acceptance, but also the ability to learn, understand and love yourself both internally and externally.\n\npeople tend to have different role models for various reasons, for example my younger sister always wanted to be like the famous singer Beyonce because she had a beautiful voice. A perfect example would be comedian Liza Koshy from YouTube who made a whole career out of being unapologetically herself while she did comedy!.Using her as inspiration would be healthier than aspiring to be just like her.\n\nWith that I conclude that being yourself is not necessarily a walk in the park but putting effort into it would make a bigger difference than following the crowd.

By being honest with yourself and setting your own expectations, you can be content with who you are and discover the valuable role that you can play in improving the world. It is to be true to yourself\u2014take the path that is unique to you.

Don't do after school homework club if you don't want extra time in school. It's difficult to do two things at once so don't do after school club.

Despite being an ace player, she was unable to participate in the game due to her class-like commitment to her after school homework club. It has been shown to negatively impact family time, significantly reduce the potential for sports and activities, and limit gaming opportunities. \n\nSimilarly, Sarah was asked to leave her basketball team on account of her having to attend her after school homework club every day. Joe had been trying to make time to attend his daughter's piano recital the past few weeks, but had to keep missing it due to the demands of his after school homework club.

They are wrong because the students not learn to much and they would have bad grades. But students do not have the same rulers at home that teachers makes at school. For example, students that are taking online classes from home, they don't have rulers and they are using their phones to watch movies or texting with friends. This is not a benefit for students..

Establishing group rules and mutually agreed-upon goals can help ensure that everyone is on the same page and that decisions are being made efficiently. \n\nFurthermore, collaborating with peers on a project or task helps us stay organized and on task. Group work allows us to gain knowledge from our peers, encouraging us to think outside of the box and come up with unique and creative solutions. With proper planning and communication, disagreements and wasted time can be minimized, allowing groups to maximize their effectiveness. Together, we were able to create a highly effective solution that drew from each of our strengths, whereas if I was working alone, the quality of the results would have likely suffered. Plus, we are able to keep up with the progress of our peers, which adds a layer of accountability to each member of the group.\n\nDespite the advantages of group work, some may argue that it can lead to wasted time and disagreements between peers. Additionally, setting due dates and holding each member of the team accountable to their individual tasks will help minimize conflicts and wasted time.\n\nTo sum up, working in a group comes with numerous benefits that can enhance the process and quality of completing an assignment. \nWorking in a group can be incredibly beneficial compared to working alone. We are more motivated to stay focused and complete the assignment in a timely manner than if we were working independently since we don't want to let our group members down. Yet, with proper planning and communication, these issues can be minimized",

This notion is particularly relevant in our modern lives, where every day we set ourselves goals and strive for success in all aspects of our lives. \n\nWinston Churchill\u2019s quote encapsulates the idea that it is possible to utilize failure to propel us towards our desired outcomes. \n\nThe key to maintaining enthusiasm throughout this process is to remain optimistic and focus on our progress.

By keeping our enthusiasm alive and staying optimistic, we set ourselves up for achieving our greatest successes..

After that you will have to work more an your payment will not be that same as before it will be less. They have to prove in their interview that they are the best of all those people before and after them.\n\nIn conclusion your successful life will come when you accomplish your goals, graduate from high school and university then find your suitable job. And not all the people can have a successful life because not everyone can go to high school neither university and those people live their life everyday hoping for a miracle to come to their life they will have to work everyday hoping that one day they will win the lottery and they will not have to work anymore. Having a positive attitude is not the key for your success in school neither in your life everyone has moments when they want to give up on everything and live in a island were you will not have to support the society that this world has.\n\nAfter years of studying a career that you didn't like hoping that when you finish you will find a suitable job for you to be successful and help your family.

Basically what I want to say is that just because you have a positive attitude it doesn't mean that you will have a car of the year, no it's not like that, for you to accomplish your goals you will need a hard working attitude and actually achieve your goals.\n\nYou are telling me that if you have a positive attitude you will graduate from high school with a advance diploma? No that is not possible, to graduate from high school is a work that you do for 12 years. Your positive attitude will not take you anywhere. Why? the answer is simple just because you are positive doesn't mean that you will accomplish your goals, complete your high school with an advance diploma or even find a job after years in the university, studying a career that you hated but decided to study that because its was the one that it will give you a better future. A positive attitude is not the key to success in life instead a hard working attitude is the the real key to success in life.

A hard working attitude will provide the commitment and dedication that is necessary in order to reach any goal.. They will strive to learn from their mistakes and seek to improve on them, rather than simply making excuses and blaming external forces. \nThe debate between a hard working attitude and a positive attitude is one that has been pursued for ages. A hard working attitude involves taking personal responsibility, setting meaningful goals, and putting the necessary amount of effort and time towards arriving at the desired outcome. It fosters a sense of relentless determination in spite of failure and requires strength of character and an unwillingness to give up. \n\nA hard worker will also be more accountable for their failures and successes. \n\nHaving a hard work attitude allows an individual to take action and turn ambition into reality rather than feelings of lofty aspirations. Possessing a hard working attitude will allow an individual to continue to strive for excellence and be rewarded with accomplishments they can be proud of. This is the kind of attitude that will ultimately be beneficial for any individual striving to reach their goals in life.\n\nUltimately, having a hard working attitude is essential for self-improvement and advancement, which are essential components in achieving success in life",

The author Ralph Emerson wrote, '' To be yourself in a world that is constlantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.'' I totally agree with Emerson's statement because be something else is not the most greatest accomplishment that you can do, the most important accomplishment that you can do in this big worl is always be yourself, be humble about everything, be kind with others, and never change the person that you really are.\n\nFirst, bring humble is one of the most important thing that we always need to have no matter what. Now she is a famous person and she have her own foundation that helps people in countries around the world like Africa, El Salvador, Mexico, Philipines. Being humble can take you to the top, to be successful in the life. That year she went to Thailand to compite for the title of Miss Universe. Marisela grow up very poor, but when she was 10 years old, she emigrated with her mom to this country looking for a better life, however, when she came here she went to the school, she learned English, and she did graduated in social communication. Six years latter, she decided to compite for Miss Universe El Salvador 2018, where she resulted the winner. In 2013 she decided to compete in a reality show that is called '' Nuestra Belleza Latina '' and she won, and with all the money that she won, she decided to founded an own restaurant for her mom in Las Vegas, Nevada. There is not other way to be happy and to demostrated to the world that you don't have to be something else to be successful and to make greatest accomplishment in your life, because the key always is going to be be yourself and be proud the person who you are.. Also she is modeling in differents countries like Paris, Spain, and Great Britain, but above all this things that shes is doing, she always still humble. For example, Marisela de Montecristo, is a salvadorian beauty queen, who wob the title of Miss Universe last year and Nuestra Belleza Latina in 2013. For example, I think that we should be kind with others, help others, because we never know when we going to need help of these people, in addition, being kind is other accomplishment that you can do in this life, and is something that you can feel proud of be.\n\nThird, never change who you really are for something passenger or for something that can not give you happiness, because be yourself is the most important thing that you can do in this big world. In one interview with Telemundo, she said that being humble is the key of being successful in the live, and I totally agree with her.\n\nSecond, be kind with others is something that defined you as a good person, because people love when someone is really interesting in help others",

Having people around you who already have been through everything were going through is very helpful because they know the steps to help you feel better since they've already been through it. Being homeschooled would be much less stressful than from actually going to school, but if you really want to learn and be a scholar, I think you'd have a better chance going to school rather than learning from home because at home you can get distracted easily.\n\nBeing taught face to face is so much easier becasue you can ask as many questions as you need to help you with your problem. also, I think your brain focuses more when you're being taught face to face than from learning through a computer. I remember this one time in math class I had an assignment I had to do and it was online, I could never understand it until I asked my teacher, personally, after that all the problems that we're similar to that one probelm I couldn't figure out, I did them in seconds and I think thats because I was being taught face to face.\n\nWhen your in school you're never alone in a classroom because there's always other classmates and when you're homeschooled and it's just you by yourself. Plus, you get more opportunities at school than learning from home, and that's because school can help you achieve you're goal and you're career, maybe not always but they can most definitely give you advice on what you can do to achieve you're goal.\n\nIn conclusion, I think you'd learn from home too, but you can learn more from school. For me it's so much easier to learn when being taught in person, because I concentrate more on the words the teacher is saying and when its through a computer I get distracted easily because there's no one around to tell me that I can't get up or go to the restroom. Having people around you while your in class isn't always as bad, I know some people get distracted easily and not concentrate while being around others, but sometimes it's good to be around other people because you never know whose around and you don't know if the answer of one those people in your class can help you in any away. Would students benefit from being able to attend classes from home? I personally don't think students would benefit learning from home because you can learn better by being taught face to face, being able to know the ideas of you're classmates, and from being around people who already know enough to help you out. Me, personally, I enjoy working with others or even just having people around me, I feel less lonely like that and well I don't really get distracted as easily because I can talk to people and and at the same time concentrate on the work i'm doing, but that's just me i don't know how others are.\n\nThirdly, going to school is actually fun, you meet new people and you don't have to be locked up in your house the whole day. This is to the people who homeschool their kids, wouldn't you rather have your kid at school where his safe, getting fed, getting his education, more opportunities on becoming someone in this world, and meeting new people in his life? or would you rather have him at home where his lonely and getting distracted easily? and it doesn't matter wether they're the ones who want to be homeschooled because you're the parent and your in control not them. I feel like being in a classroom full of other people is better than being at home and learning on your own. In middle school I remember that I wouldn't talk to no one that worked at the school because I didn't trust them, until this day I still don't trust them but it wouldn't hurt you to be around them and ask questions about something you need",

To this day, both of these figures remain as important symbols of freedom and justice for generations to come..

For example, my friend PROPER_NAME who rather attend his classes online and also rather spend his time playing video games and not with his family or friends.\n\nDistance learning can benefit students who have disabilities.

It's also not helping a student to become smarter or to learn more. I believe students should not be required to take a music, a drama, or an art class.

Then they can start to expand their career at a young age. But many might not go for that career in the future . For example , I am in the 11th grade, and I still have not committed to a career. When you were in high school would you have commit the career you have now?\n\nMany people do know what they want to do for their career, but others do not. But it is always a pretty good idea to know what career you want to do at a young age. It always good to know what you want to study for at a young age, so you do not have to worry about it in the future.\n\nStudents still not knowing what to commit to and having to commit to a career that the students might not like in the future are my two main supports to my opinion. Its a big part of a students life to commit to some thing they are going to be doing as their career. It is also a lot of pressure for students to figure out what they want to do for the rest of their lives.\n\nWhen students go to high school , some of them want do explore different class to figure out what exactly, they want to do as their career. Maybe it is because they found a different career that they love but figured it out at a different age.\n\nI see some people that are over 30, and are not happy with the career they committed to at a young age. If I knew what career exactly I wanted to commit , I would have been taking classes for that specific career in high school. In my opinion committing to a career at a young age is not a good idea. Some might say they want to be a doctor, lawyer, or even a teacher. There are many people that choose a career at a young age, and now years later, they are not happy or they get bored. I choose these two, because I think it supports my opinion the best. It is better to have students study what career they want to commit to , so they can start to studying for it . Students can always figure out what career they want in college , they do not have to know right away . They do not like going to work as much. A lot of high school students do not know what they want to have as their career. In the last 2 years, I was able to see what I might want to commit to and ones I do not have interest in. But when they started to study for that career ,it was a little to late because they committed to it. . Also when they committed to a career, they could have through it was totally different ",
      "ai_text": "Furthermore, you may change your mind as you get older and find it harder to adjust to a different career. Young people tend to be particularly energetic and motivated and so can focus on their career ambitions early on. However, committing to a career too early can be detrimental to personal growth. On the positive side, an early commitment can help to focus your education and give you an impetus to work hard towards your chosen goal. You may miss out on trying new activities and exploring different paths. \nCommitting to a career at a young age can have both advantages and drawbacks. Therefore, committing to a career at a young age can be a substantial decision and it is important to carefully consider the pros and cons.",

Finally,\n\nyou will learn how to make wise choices by learning from the lessons that an expert or authority could offer you.\n\nSome people say that having someone telling you what to do will limit you from choosing what's best for you. Furthermore, relying on with an expert will give you the chance to learn new lessons and in the future give you the opportunity to make your own decisions. This will allow you to learn from his teachings and experiences and reflect about them. Therefore, experts and authorities will be there to not let you fail and always look for what's best for you.\n\nIn conclusion, seeking from guidance from experts may not give you the freedom to make your own decisions, but it will help you accomplish your goals rapidly and efficiently. For example, when I was in middle school I used to think that doing individual work was faster and easier. Furthermore, in the course of the path with an expert guiding you, you will learn a lot of things that will help you make better choices. . People who value self-reliance define it as the need for each individual to follow his or her own instincts and ideas. As the quote says, I think that it's very important to have someone to guide us throughout the course of our lives. As I grew older I understood that my brother was just guiding me through the right path. Thus, seeking for guidance from experts can help you achieve any goal you set in life and avoid wastig your time on making wrong decisions.\n\nIn addition, you will learn and gain experience if you have someone expert to guide you. Since experts have already experienced many rough situations in life, they will know how to make decisions that will benefit us in the best way. Experts and authorities can provide us with advices to make good decisions in life and accomplish our goals more easily.\n\nFirst of all, having someone to guide you throughout the decisions you make in life could help you accomplish a goal a lot easier. This experience showed me the importance of always having someone to give you their opinion to accomplish a goal quickly and avoid wasting your time. In whatever manner, I rarely got to choose my own decisions because my brother was always there telling what decisions to make. Finally, you will avoid wasting a lot of your life's time trying to follow your own instincts and ideas. However, I noticed that most of my classmates who worked in groups finished all the assignments in less time than I did. There is a quote that says, \"If you want to go fast go by yourself, but if you want to far go with someone else\".

Additionally, in some cases, seeking guidance from an expert can leave us feeling misguided and confused if their advice does not lead us in the right direction.  \n\nFurthermore, having someone to turn to when looking for guidance can give us the confidence and reassurance we need to make a decision with courage and conviction. It can also be beneficial for gaining the experience and knowledge necessary to make our own decisions in the future.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s important to remember that in some cases, relying on someone else's advice can limit our own ability to think independently and form our own decisions. They are often the best source of relevant and objective advice. It is therefore always important to consider the merits of both options when making any major decision in life..

Always take your time its your future. obvious you would have to take extra classes, and to make those up you have a choice to take it during the summer, online, or night school which ever is best. .

During the last two years of the four, in Generic_City I had be slacking off from my practices. But you can give a lot of time to decide whether or not you will ever be happy from doing something you don't currently want to do. I saw a kid magazine with a toy violin that came along with it. We found out there was after-school lessons I could take. Every since we left Generic_City, I had not touched a violin in a year and that is when I was reminiscing on the days when I was playing the violin. The thoughts of how the violin was not going to take me anywhere always lingered in my mind. I would love to improve on my talent more instead of throwing it all out, it would be a big waste to do so.\n\nYou should always push yourself to a current limit though, not until you breakdown. I pretended like it was a real violin, and strung the strings with my fake bow. My dad had made me a daily schedule for me to practice everything, so I could increase my talent and abilites. After countless of arguments, cries, and rants to friend, I realized that no one can convince me to enjoy the violin again instead, I had to convince myself to. On the first lesson, I felt really nervous because my wish was finally coming true. Soon, came to my realization that the violin is something you could not master in just in a year. Yet, I still wanted to continue with my talent and not give up. I was not improving as much, as I was back in Generic_City. Eventually, she gave in and bought me the toy violin. I thought to myself, why did I hate practicing and going to lessons so much? The violin is something that I could never let go of because of the amount of work and years put into it. The violin is a hard instrument to master, even with many years. Reasons just kept piling up till I told my parents about my thoughts and feelings. Suddenly, everything felt like the very first lesson I took in 2013. The new instructor said I was pretty good and could immediately start on the second book, instead of the first \"beginners\" book. I always enjoyed playing the violin, but it began a chore. It could really be just a phase you could be having. My family and I had moved back to Generic_City, and I did not have any violin lessons. Of course, I was not good at all on day one. It felt great knowing I was off to a great start.\n\nEverything was going fine for the next five months, until I started to slack off again but worse. After a few years went, I had moved to Generic_City and my parents decided I should actually get lessons on the violin in 2013. That is how I grew my skills, and my talent in violin more. Soon enough, I was given lessons for the violin. The best feeling is honestly really great knowing that you weren't pushing yourself to do something you didn't want to do anymore. I really thought I was going to be perfect on the first day. It was dejavu all over again from 7 years ago. Ever since I had gotten that toy violin, I would not stop bringing it everywhere with me. I still practiced and slightly improved, but I still unhappy. After a few months went by in Generic_City, I begged my parents to let me take lessons on violin. I always had a great amount of interest in violins as a kid. Our family was moving once again, but to Virginia. They had told me it would be a waste of six years worth of money for me to give up. I also grew to enjoying the violin more. That's how I was able to go through the \"first phase\" of violin lessons went by.\n\nSaturday afternoons felt super weird since I was not attending any lessons. I did not feel happy about the violin for the next three years. With those skills, my talent on the violin has increased over the years and overcame phases.\n\nWhen I first shown interest in violins, as I remember, was in Generic_City back in 2008. It was not my dream to be a famous violinist or an instructor. You can tell if someone is doing something they clearly don't want to do, but are forcing themselves.          .

Despite the initial difficulty, I saw firsthand the sheer joy of mastering a new piece and was inspired by those around me to push my limits and strive to get to the point of being able to perform confidently.\n\nAt the same time, I realized the detrimental consequences of not practicing regularly. As I conducted research into the instrument's history, I developed an even greater appreciation for its extraordinary heritage and the history of its renowned composers. Neglecting practice can lead to slipping technical ability, as well as a loss of confidence and motivation. I was enchanted by the complexity and range of emotion that the instrument could convey when played skillfully. Through this experience, my attitude and perspective on the violin shifted from a source of struggle to a place of peace and comfort. \nGrowing up, I was entranced by the beautiful sound of the violin\u2014a classical instrument which has been in existence since the 16th century in Europe.

But they have to know that nothing going to be in the way they want but they can keep going until they can achive their purpose. Not all the time going to be easy. It just going to help us to go through the way of failure. But nothing can be hard at all, we have to know that all is posible, we dont have to take it as imposible. For some of them the situation is hard, but at the end we can see them in their way to graduate and how proud they are of themselves because it's not easy to learn english.\n\nAlso, we can see the organizations that want to help to the people who doesn't have nothing, they have to do a lot of thing and have to be prepare because no one know if they gonna get what they want. Not all of them have the support of the family to cover the cost to pay the the clas in the university. We must have to fail a lot of time, but we have to have in mind that we can do it. Sometimes we dont get the result on what we have been worked. She had to do a concert to get the money to start with her fundation, she has been in hard situation but she always believed in herself",

Because people grow up every single day, people learn new things from things they mastered in,and people grow no matter what they in .\n\nFirstly,people learn new things everyday. Most people spend more time to mastered in what they want to do but the more you study the more you grow knowing all kinds of things. it does matter how mastered you have be paient with kids,\n\nteach them everyday and more the you the kids the more grow to understand not only how to eat but so many thing they saw from you. For example,when I first move to America, it was hard for to master or get used to the culture ,food ,speaking but the more I learn more about the country the more i grow in it. Specially, people like my who have been teaching for this whole life is even grow as new generation comes in. people normally change or grow when there is to learn about what they mastered in. For example ,it like teaching a kids how to eat. For example ,doctor grow more when they have to learn more about something have ever seen all done but in same field work. I like how some student take cosmetology, they take this for two year to have a certificate but that does mean the student all have mastered in it so that is it. we may mastered in one thing but it have so many things connected to it .that can help throght life without changing your the career ,job or whatever it may be. it laso teach them to skill not only on make up and hair but to be paient with costumers and their own friend too. In fact ,even a busness can only grow if the CEO of the company have mastered on that position and ready to learn more things about it. moreover, people can grow throght new education about their woke.\n\nSometimes, people grow through new ability about their work or what have mastered in. Besides this ,people grow every single day.\n\nHowever, Some people grow single day. I said this because many learn more grow when there is a new change in syetem of education, economics ,bussines. Based on mine on experiences, I disagree with Emerson's statement. Author Ralph waldo Emerson wrote,\"unless you try to do something beyound what you have already mastered , you will never grow \". when it comes to studies and growing, alot of people try their best to master in what they are trying to do",

Similarly, learning a complex craft such as knitting or woodworking provided me with a sense of personal satisfaction and increased confidence.\n\nHowever, growth is not limited to mastering a skill. \nRalph Waldo Emerson famously said, \u201cBy growth we mean the enlargement of our powers and facilities, the opening to us of vaster resources of action.\u201d To him, and many others, mastering a skill as part of the process of self-improvement and growth is essential.

Firstly, students are able to enter college or the job market one year early. By putting in the effort to bypass traditional high school curriculums, students are able to enter college or the work force at an earlier age, thereby giving them a head start over those who are the same age but stuck in high school for the standard four years.\n\nIn terms of the effort required to achieve this goal, the most important is to be organized and dedicated. They may also need to be flexible in their approach to the different classes they take, and take online or other external classes to fully fill out the requirements.\n\nThe advantages of graduating early are manifold. The payoff of being able to enter college or the job market more quickly is likely to outweigh the effort required to achieve this goal, leading to a more successful future.. Furthermore, since many college credits can be earned at the high school level, early grads may be able to take on full-time college courses during their first year of college. Early grads need to stay focused and be willing to take more courses in any given semester to compensate for the lack of time. This means they are more likely to secure a well-paying job and also have the opportunity to advance more quickly in their career",

There are many reasons why most people are afraid of asking their friends or family for advice is because they are scared they might judge them or laugh at them. The truth is if you wanna help your friends or even family members you need to give them the right opinions that you have and help them find other people who can help them and give them their opinions. Now by attention I don't mean something as so they could get the parents attention I mean they might be asking for your advice because you are the parent and you know what's right for your own kid and you want to always make sure you support them no matter what.\n\nWhat I am writing about is something that I have been through in life. Always keep in mind that just because that person does not want to tell you anything does not mean they are ok or they don't need help, always try to talk to them and tell them that you care and you want to help them. I knew that my friend was going through something so I tried talking to her and helped her by giving my opinions of what she can do and what she should do in order to slove her problems. Asking for advice can also mean asking someone if you are making the right choice. By giving her many opinions she was able to overcome her problems and she was always happy and she was starting to speak a little more english and it was like as if she was a whole new person.\n\nThis might not be easy for many people who has a close friend that is going through something and they don't want to talk about it because most of the time they are shy or they don't want people to know. Why does most people want multiple advice when they are seeking for advice? As human beings we all go through hard times in life because that is how life works. When we go through those hard times we want to ask for help from maybe a friend, family, or just anyone that is close to you and you know them very well. For my final reason I think this reason is the really importent in my opinion because this is what a lot of time kids, teens, go through is people might think they are doing this for attention. Everyday when she came to class she was always sad or she was always in the office. Something else that is really helpful when seeking multiple opinions is, it helps the person make a better choice. Seeking for advice does not only mean you are having trouble with something. She did knew some words like how to say hi or say her name, but that was all she could speak. Something else most people are afraid is their family or friends might think they are crazy or they are just making things up. Again this might not be so easy for the person, but it opens more doors for them and it makes them feel like they do have a way out of their problems.\n\nIn 6th grade I had a really great friend she came from a different countrie and she was from Generic_City, and had no idea how to speak english. There were a lot of times in my life where a lot of my friends were going through really hard times in life and most of the pain they were going through was their families not caring or thinking that their kid is crazy and they just want attention. Something that parents need to keep in mind is that when your kid asks for advice don't think they are crazy or they just want attention because that is not the point, they just want help with what they are going through. Something that we have to remember is that not evryone is not ok with asking people for their advice.        . Again by attention I don't mean something as so they can get the parents attention I mean they might be asking for your advice because you are the parent and you know what's right for your own kids and you want to always make sure you support them no matter what. After a couple of mounths in school I noticed that she was having a very hard time in school because many people bullied her. This can also build up the persons confidence and it helps them to open up more with their feelings and they can try to talk to their family members or their friends more often.\n\nNow why is Seeking Multiple opinions really importent? Well I just told you there are many reasons why it's importent. It helps people to know they matter and there is a sloution to their problems no matter what they are going through",

People think that there is a lot of information in school, college, and even a job that they have to go through just to have success in life. They also say that they have to work hard to pay for their house, their bills, health insurance, car insurance, and even for their family. Others say that it won't help their career in the future. Another reason why you should be successful is if people finish everything they need for their career, then they don't have to deal with it in the future than having to deal with it later. Failure is not the end of the world, people just got to find what is best for them. Most people in the world are gonna say \"practice makes perfect.\" Another example is that my sister wanted to go to UVA, and she studied hard to get into that college, my family thought they wouldn't accept it, but a few weeks later, they accepted her in UVA. Even if people don't succeed in life it is fine because they still have a chance, all they got to do is to study hard and work hard for it because in the future they will not regret it.          . What Minister Churchill is trying to say is that going from failure to success is not gonna be easy in life. What could they do to reach their career and have success? People will agree with this statement. The people in the world that say that it is a waste of time are the people that can be homeless or the people that just have no life at all.\n\nLastly, the reason why that everyone should always go from failure to success is because it's gonna make people feel good about there selves. Here is another example, my Math and History have good grades, but my English and Science don't have good grades, so not everyone is gonna have good grades, people have strengths and weaknesses, they just got to study and work because not everyone is perfect.\n\nIn addition, some others may say that going from failure to success is a waste of time. People just got to try harder even if it takes years to achieve. Things aren't gonna be easy, people just got to understand that it is life, we just got to work harder.\n\nOn the other hand, most people in the world experience this. There is not one person in the world that didn't have any issues throughout their whole life. Not everyone is gonna succeed in life, we all make mistakes. For example, my friends told someone that playing basketball is not a good sport for him, but overtime he has gotten better at basketball. Even in school, it is very unlikely to find someone that is not having a hard time with there classes. Going from failure to success in life is not easy, but they just got to have the potential to reach that goal.\n\nFirst, some people may tell others that going from failure to success is a good thing.

One way to do this is to stay motivated and focus on the positive aspects of the situation. \n\nIn conclusion, for those people who are looking to find a path from failure to success, it is important to stay motivated and take risks. For example, failure can be emotionally taxing, and the journey from failure to success can be long and difficult. While there is a risk associated with failure, it is important for people to understand that they can find a way to turn failure into success.

      "human_text": "I already know what career I want to take and the classes that are recommended for that specific career, and it is actually good because I can learn more about that career, I know that I am capable for the career I want and that it will not be hard for me since I always liked what I want to do which is about computers, and technology related. Some students finish high school and then they decide to do this type of careers which sometimes work for few of them, they reached their goals and sometimes they don't even finish high school, but if they can't accomplish this, then they have all they need which is their diploma or they can continue with their studies to get the job they would like to have.\n\nIn conclusion, is a good thing that students commit to a career early so they can be prepared for the future this will also help them develop their capacity when they go to college where things will get a little bit hard for them. Some students don't have the support of their parents like I do and they just decide to finish high school and be done which is not really good if they want to get a job that will give them a lot of money, and most of the jobs requires you to have a degree of some sort or specific for that job.\n\nThere are jobs that don't ask for anything just the high school diploma, but those jobs don't really pay that much, and they are kind of heavy, not all of them but most of them. For example, I like to play soccer, but I am not good enough to make a career out of it, so I decided to finish my studies, follow my career, and get the job that I would like. Most of the students do this and they success in their careers, I would to the same because I know high school will help me get prepare for college, and I don't have to feel the pressure of not knowing anything all, I already have a little bit of understanding and knowledge.. Playing sports like soccer, basketball, tennis, or baseball can give you a chance to make money, for example, you can have a career out of that, but you most good for big teams to pick you up and pay you which payment is a lot if you make it to the big teams.\n\nThis doesn't always work for everyone only for the talented ones that were meant to be good at each of the careers. Not all the time going to college to get a degree so you can get a job is the only way to get money or make a living out of it. Some students don't know or can't decide what career they want to take, and that is not okay because they most know by the time they are at least in 11th grade, so school can give them the appropriate classes to prepare them for that career, and those classes to help them when they go to college. For example, you can be a singer, and if your music is loved by most of the people you can success and make money out of it by selling albums or promoting your songs to different platform in internet. Most of the time students do not want to commit to a career at a young age because they are either so stressed out from school and they feel like they cannot decide what career they want to take or because they feel like it is not really going to help them much on what they choose. Some jobs like construction, and plumber don't require that you need to have a college degree just the high school diploma, and this jobs also pay really good, but they are really tiring and heavy, mostly construction that you have to be outside in that hot temperature or cold. This could be a benefit for them, since they are young and have the capacity to learn faster, also if they are in high school it would be good for them to be guided at a young age to help them on a career they would like to take, and when they go to college,they don't find the stuff they are going to see complicated, and they are somewhat prepare and have an idea of what they are going to learn if they choose to go to college.\n\nI think it is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age because it helps students prepare their mentality, knowledge, and give them an idea of what they are going to see, and focus on the career they want to choose. In most cases student are committed to a career at a young age by school or their parents to guide them early. My parents also recommend me to commit to my career at young age so I can learn and practice my skills. If you compare this jobs with like a being a doctor, dentists, or technician; this jobs requires you to have a college degree, and you have to go to college for either 2,3,4 or 5 years so you can get the degree of any of this careers, and they pay you a lot and it is not heavy and you don't expose yourself to hot or cold temperatures, and that is a benefit for you if you want to have a really sotf or calm job.\n\nBasically if you know what career you want to take, and you prepare yourself like taking all your classes, and what you need, you should be good for the most part. In fact, not going prepare to college it can be complicated to students and probably stressful since they have no idea what so ever of what they are going to see or learn. For example, when you know what career you want to take since the beginning of high school and you are focus on that career, and you take the classes that will help you be prepare for that career, when you go to college you have an idea, and you are not going to be as stress as other students who didn't want to take advantage of that.\n\nI would personally take the chance so I can be prepared for college, I think if I take classes that will help me be prepared it would obviously be good for me",
      "ai_text": "The mental and knowledge preparation that is a part of committing to a career at a young age is also one of its benefits, as they will have the time to explore different career options and become properly informed of what the job will entail. \nCommitting to a career at a young age has many advantages. For one, those who are younger often have the capacity to learn faster, meaning that they can get ahead with their career preparations sooner. On the other hand, students who don't want to commit to choosing a career at a young age may find themselves with a disadvantage later on; without having the time to find out what career they would ideally like, they may find themselves accepting jobs they don't want out of desperation. By committing to a career at a young age, students can ensure that they get the most out of their education and embark on the career path they have chosen with confidence.",

We don't do things we want to do because of our insecurities and our laziness when there is a lot of people dying to have an opportunity. Show others trust and appreciation for everything they get , be happy for them and give them more motivation.\n\nGeneric_Name an English teacher said \"People just see the defect in other person's life without seeing in their person's first\" . A lot of girls bother her, and others saw her crying and hurt and they didn't stop them. There is a lot of people doing a lot of activities everyday and some others doing nothing than just watch TV. Unluckily purposes don't come by itself as a miracle. It won't be perfect at the first try , it may not be the same thing that we were expecting, but the effort you put is what it counts. This is so truth , we don't see in ourselves first , we spend more time critizating and wishing bad luck to those making their purposes , feeling jealous of them because they could do it and we could't because we didn't want to put effort and time so we'd rather give up and do nothing than just complain about it and make excuses .That is not a reason , choosing a goal or purpose is something we need take it seriously because if you take it like a game then we are wasting your time , and the time of those person's helping us and going through all our steps , in our mentality has to be all positive .Being more strong than our bad thoughts feel proud of us,because we are doing something that others can't do. What we can really do is confront the reality , understand our mistakes try to solve them ,try to get better by the time . If we fall down we need to stand up again , dropping some tears and being in bed all day won't help , think in what other people might think about us won't do anything than just make us feel even more weak. We can't limit ourselves with good stuff we need to spend time and learn new things , experience , teach other people and share our experiences and recommend and help others to never quit. It is necessary to take our time to make this things possible, it is necessary to have clearly our mind and see what are we capable to do and how far we can go . Every person has a different purpose,some purposes are complicated to reach,and there's also some less complicated but doesn't make any difference because every person decides and picks what are their purposes and whether if they give up or they do anything to reach them. We won't feel good after that and we'll feel embarrass of ourselves , we wouldn't be capable of going out with our mind thinking in what other people is thinking . Her bones and body develop she got skinnier and after she got back to school everyone got impressed .Now she was more confident and it wasn't easy , it took time , tears , sacrifices but she did it . Quit is the easy way to give up , and that is they way to demonstrate weakness the people that didn't trust in us would laugh and spread the rumors of our fail. After everything we'll feel great and proud of what we've done.\n\nIt is hard to try without being scared , without doubt .Believe in our capacities is something that we stopped doing , and say I can't became more common and we hear that everyday. Among the time the girl started to eat healthier and started to walk everyday she was adding one more lap ,then she started to jug and after run . Each human person in the world have a purpose , goal to get in a future and is something that we really want to have in our life. This is a experience that taught me to see different the things , to see how we can do it\n\n, if we want , if we put a lot of effort and we are patient to see the changes. Thomas Jefferson wrote \"Determine never to be idle..It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing\".\n\nSome person's give up easily, they think is impossible, hard, complicated, but basically what they are doing is waste their capacity to make something and improve themselves, just because someone doesn't trust in our capacity means we have to stop doing what we like and quit . Always is better to try than just watch .Everyone has their daily things to do , some people work , others study , others do both or more things and they don't have time for them. We don't need to take care of what others say, they might give us advises but we are the only ones deciding our actions.\n\nWhat the quote means is how we make bad decisions an sometimes we just do what others do,or we just quit to something we were trying to do and it was hard so we drop off that and now we don't do anything else than watch others happy for getting their purpose. A lot of people accomplish more if they are always doing something and others ask if inactivity also serve as a purpose. It is so much emotions going on and we can't describe the feeling after we went through all that and we finally did it,we got our purpose we make it and the feeling of victory is inexplicable,we need more positivism in us.. We are trying we aren't being like the rest and that make us unique ans specials, show to whoever said we could't do it or make it how wrong they were and they judge us before knowing our capacities. No one is perfect we might see people getting their purposes easily and we can't understand how , what we don't know is the reality of how the live by the way we don't need to be comparing our live with others life .\n\nA girl from school had extra weight and she didn't played any sports , she was lazy to walk and all her friends were skinny and she felt bad about herself and very ashamed of her body she tried to lose weight but slowly she was quitting ,she was crying a lot and feeling weird and unwanted by everyone , some students started to judge her and no one wanted be her friend and they were bullying her .

Not because of the time but for those students that would decide that they would not only risk to fell some classes but also not to take elective classes during summer because that's what this prompt says.\n\nIt will be more stressful:\n\nAs we all know school sometimes can be stressful but imagine how stressful if for students that graduate in four years as every other normal programs that high schools offer, now imagine how it would it be for students that take programs allowing them to graduate in three years.

My position about this prompt is that students should not take the program that allow students to graduate them in three years, because is not like taking normal classes, for example what would happen if students get to take the program that will allow them to graduate in 3 years?\n\nThey would have to take more classes in less time:\n\nBecause as I read in the prompt there was one part that says \"for students in order to graduate must take summer courses\", and this means that they would not have a break in this time",

What is success without failure?\n\nI can infer that the mentioned statement Prime Minister Winston had provided has an strong point of view from many perspectives. . To be able to achieved your expected goals without loosing enthusiasm, and demonstrating resilience is the greatest accomplishment. It exposes how human behavior react with the idea that success is not only one extraordinary idea. I strongly agree with the Churchill's statement regardless to the critical role failure plays in life. It influences in many adolescences, gives the hope of being able to achieved their expected accomplishments and it provides higher knowledge from their mistakes. Society has been exacerbating this concept by creating irrational fear in those who are not willing to take risks to become better persons once they seemed to have failed, which leads to the mediocrity of the world.\n\nFurthermore, there are many people who were born in a extremely poor region, yet they became successful persons due to the hard work they constantly showed and the multiple failures they have experienced, that helped them work harder on specific goals, and that have made an enormous impact in many young minds since it exposes how someone could be able to achieved anything they are expecting, if you keep trying. We, as humans tend to follow other's behavior to feel accepted by society. Success means being able to manage the situation with resilience and perseverance even if they seem to have made multiple mistakes. It gives the enthusiasm every individuals need in order to be successful in life, it motivates young minds to follow their expectations, and provides more knowledge in many cases since we learn from our mistakes.\n\nAccordingly to many researches, individuals tend to give up when they are facing an obstacle in a complicated occasion, that prevented most of society to stop achieving their accomplishments due to the constant fear of experiencing failure. If individuals were to give up in the first try, we would be a world with ignorant in it.\n\nMoreover, It is psychological proven that a brain can effectively works in better conditions, if they seem to be in a place where failure could be the main issue. A successful person is the one who have seem to dedicated their time to be able to greatly achieved their dreams. If we keep encouraging people to practice resilience, they would most likely be able to manage every hard situation in life and would have the courage to keep trying even if they are aware they might fail, in other words, they would be practicing negative reinforcement that is based on failing but being aware they could have rewards at the end.\n\nOverall, Failure plays an essential role in the pursuit of success since it gives individuals the challenge of becoming better human being and achieving their goals regardless to the situation",

What i'm trying to say is takeing a risk is not always bat every thing happens for a reson at lest that is what my parants said. and let me tell you I had a lot of fun reading that book. these thing is are in you every day life so you have to becarful,take risks,and take other oppenions. taking big riskes is a part of our lives every human being took a risk at lest ones in there lives sometimes you would not evan know that you took that risk but in realty you did for example im take a risk typing this ovesly the conscances are not that big but they still mater in life.\n\nMy oppenion is to watch out, becareful, and take the risk like I sad riskes dont alway tearn out bad. I had to make a good disagon becouse if I did not then it would have been a wast of $15.

I evan told my frinds about it and they where like \"can I chick it out\" if i sed no i would sound disrspactful so I said sure ill bring it tomorrow in lunch.\n\nTaking more then one oppenion might be time consuming but trust me it will help you make a 90% better choose then if you would just run in blind and start makeing bad chooses. if you do lesson to every thing I said in this your oppenions to others would change a lot and what i mean by that is you will look at many thing in a differant precpactive, your disagon makeing would change lats say you take six peaples oppenions three of them said there favert coler was blue and the other three said green now this is when a risk comes in now you are going to chose a coler lats say you chose blue now the numbers have changed 4 blue and 3 green so blue won.                         .

Taking the input of more than one person and considering multiple angles is an essential part of the decision-making process.\n\nThis was something I realized during my sophomore year in college when my professor assigned us a group project. Taking multiple opinions into account and having the courage to take a leap of faith will help you become more confident in your decisions and achieve things you never thought were possible.. Without having all of us involved and working together, the project would have been much less successful.\n\nIn addition, it is just as important to take risks. However, it is important to remember that no matter how certain you might be that your opinion is right, one person's opinion is rarely enough to reach a successful resolution. Although it was a bit of a roller coaster, I quickly learned about the city and grew an appreciation for it while meeting amazing people and making lifelong connections.\n\nIt is these risks that are often the biggest rewards. With each member in the group bringing a unique perspective and expertise, we were able to come up with a unique and creative solution to the project that none of us would have thought of alone.

While praise may be beneficial in small doses, celebrating successes holistically and emphasizing the journey rather than the result can be just as, if not more, rewarding for a student - and is less likely to have a negative effect. But on the flip side, there is also evidence that suggests an excessive amount of praise can have a detrimental effect. Giving praise too often can lead students to become dependent on external validation, making them less likely to take initiative and self-motivate if it doesn't come with the promise of a reward. \nMotivating a student without the use of praise can be a difficult but important task for educators and parents. .

Sometimes he has to do two homeworks each day just for one class. Essays and reading books counts as a big percent of his grade. Doing their work in their own will develop a self- decipline.\n\nOne of the main reasons why schools of the United States shouldn't offered students to attend classes online from their is because it requires more work from the students. The real world need students who like to interact with people not shy students. Making students to attend classes online happens will change many students lives. Although some say that offering online classes by the school would be more beneficial, actually it won't be beneficial for students who wants to attend online classes offered by the school because it will require more work for students and students will have less interaction with people face to face.\n\nThose who believe schools should offer online classes have reasons. Also, students are afraid to interact with other people face to face because they spend most of time in their computers. He is attending one class online from his home. If students want to take other classes they won't have time to do it.

Students don't see benefits of attending online classes, instead it just make their life difficult in many ways..

Without this condition of accountability, students are more likely to receive a sub-par education.\n\nFurthermore, it is impossible to replicate the real-world experience from a computer.

The process of thinking about your ideas.\n\nOur stance on the matter of self-reliance in humans stans to show people need to be self reliant because it is good to not distinctly require independence on any other. These types of situations is what most people struggle with, but this helps people benefit from themselves.\n\nWe all value self-reliance to the fact that if someone makes their own decisions they have to solve the problem. With self-reliance, one is more keen on their own inabillities and strives to problem solve with a more in-depth and notable understanding.. Guidance is helpful if there are no choices that the person sees that needs it. With guidance it can be helpful, it can also be misleading and people aren't completely following their instincts. People who are self-reliance are capable of doing the same tasks they are in. Like when we shop, you choose between two or more pieces of clothing",
      "ai_text": "The decisions we make can have a considerable impact on the outcome, so it is important to consider all the consequences and think logically before we act. Ultimately, self-reliance is the key to personal growth and success.. \n\nIn conclusion, self-reliance is an incredibly valuable trait that is both necessary and beneficial. For example, a student who is struggling to write a difficult essay may need to rely on themselves in order to overcome the challenge. \n\nIn real life, self-reliance can be seen as a problem-solving tool when faced with various obstacles. \n\nThe thought process behind self-reliance is personal and divergent. It is the ability to make decisions and cope with the consequences, both good and bad, in order to achieve a certain goal. Seeking help and guidance from others can be helpful, but it is ultimately up to the student to make the final decisions and take the necessary steps to reach success. It requires the individual to assess the situation, consider potential options, and weigh the pros and cons of each decision before making a final choice. It is impossible to progress without the ability to make informed decisions and face the consequences alone. It cultivates a sense of independence and autonomy that is necessary for growth and personal development. They must navigate their surroundings, make decisions, and weather the consequences in order to secure resources and thrive. \n\nThe same applies to nature, where animals and plants must use self-reliance to survive in their ever-changing environment. \nSelf-reliance is an essential human characteristic that is both necessary and beneficial",

Team sports, races, and competitions can bring out the best of children, who are looking for a chance to learn and grow at the same time. When done right, activities can be enjoyable and educational simultaneously. It can be a chore or a pleasant experience, depending on how activities are implemented. These activities require the use of key listening, coordination, and analytical skills, while also allowing the student to explore music theory, composition, and history.

As such, educational activities should be seen as an ideal way to foster long lasting learning that can be both enjoyable and educational.. It can be as simple as playing a game of tag, where the children have to use their knowledge of math and geometry, or using a basketball court to illustrate the basics of angles and trajectories.

This is a powerful idea that encourages us to challenge ourselves and venture into new areas of knowledge and understanding. \n\nFor instance, a few months ago I decided to rely on myself for a project that I was tackling.

Furthermore, some teacher put onerous on students, which they giving out homework and big project for a test grade just because they don't want the student to forget the information that they have learn. For example, an exchange student from Vietnam came to United State with her parents for emergrates, but her siblings still live in Vietnam because they were married before sign up. Going out with friends but still have to bring paper and pencil to do homework is very humor. For instance, teachers love give homework during the break for no reason. Students need break but a short break is unnecessary.\n\nTo begin with, students are waiting for a long summer break where they can spend all their time at the place that they wish to be at. The summer break should be longer and less short break because students need more time for their vacation, and they will not have to worry the homework that they left at home.\n\nWhile many people believe that the summer break should be shorten, a longer winter break and a week off in the spring and fall because the educators feels that if the break too long and that students do not retain information as easily when they return in the fall, this is a week argument. Whereas many people argue that the break should be year-round schools, and it should be a 3-4 week break in summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall.        . Students didn't expect teachers to finish grading their work during the break, but teachers expect them to finish the big project, it is unfair for students.\n\nAs a final point, the summer break should be longer because students need more time for their vacation, and they will not have to worry the homework that they left at home. Summer break is what educators and students are looking forward for. Further more, students will not want to go back to school after few days off. The long break is much better than a short and unnecessary break. For instance, a break in the middle of the school year easy to get students forget what they have learn. Imagine an aboard student come from different country that is far away from United State, so she need a long summer break to return to her country for visit her family. The part time work that students make during school year does help but not much for preparing or satisfy the claim inside teenager.\n\nIn addition, people want to have a relax time on a long vacation, none of the students want to be thinking that they still have work waiting for them at home and the deadline is coming.

Furthermore, short summer breaks reduce the amount of disruptive absences; this allows students to maintain the same peer group over the course of the academic year, providing them with a sense of accessibility as well as the ability to form relationships with their peers, teachers, and school faculty. \n\nOverall, both short and long summer breaks provide students with potential educational benefits, and it is ultimately up to the students and their families to decide what works best for them.. For example, classroom environments are structured to provide students with a consistent and secure learning atmosphere \u2014 something which they may not have access to over a long summer break.

The communication is important and many cases because with communication you can do many things, like if you don't understand something you can tell somebody for help and all the persons on the groups can practice all days to do a great work,and also some student's need a lot of help so students that know more can join to the groups to help the others,but sometimes is not because some students don't know how to do the work sometimes it because they don't understand sometimes is because the language is a problems for some student's so there is good to make groups to help them,Third it can be an experience to work in groups because some students that don't know each others later on they can be friends and work in groups it can be helpful to students,but also to school because work on groups students can understand more and they can get betters grades also work in groups and a a good relationship it can be helpful not only at the school it can be helpful like in your home with the family and not to get in trouble with their, but also it can help you on your job to work well and not to have problems with the people that you work with,is like on soccer that why it call a soccer team because they help each others they share new or more strategies that it can help others to do a great job because work in groups students have more and betters benefits to do a great job,Finally is good to have a good communication in groups because with a great communication all the the group can understand each others and is important to have a good relationship in the group so like that they can do a better job and some students help others and that is great to be generous with others because if you help to someone that need help other people is going to help you on what you need and is a lot much better to work in group than alone sometimes when you are working alone and you got stuck in something no body is going to help you,but if you are working with more people in group they going to help you on what you need but most of the teachers want's to students work alone sometimes is good that students work alone because sometimes students got distracted for the people on the group and the teachers don't wants students to copy each others sometimes is good to work alone maybe better concentration,but sometimes is not that good to work alone because sometimes you got stuck in somethig, but if you are working with a group they are going to help you i would like to see more teachers that put more student's to work in group i don't think student's would like to work alone than with a group is better an sometimes is more easy and faster\n\nIn conclusion, is a great idea for me thats teachers make students to work in groups on my opinion is much helpful to they work in groups instead to work alone,because when people work in groups they have betters ideas and they can do a better work with more interesting and more opinions is better to do a great job and also have a great relationship and a great communication is so important to work in a group and some students know more than others so the students thats know more is good that they help the others on what they need and is good to work in group so like that you can know others people i hope teachers continuing making groups to students can learn more than what they know and work in group it can help you on your life because if you got a job and many people work there too but you don't like to work with others people as a group the boss is going to kick you out only because you don't know how to work as a group and if you only like to work alone it can be a problem if you don't understand work with others people is better always more ideas,opinions like that you can do a better work and it can help your future job and the rest of your life sometimes some student's don't like to work in group's sometimes it because they don't know others people,but i thing if teachers would like to student's work more in groups i thing they would like it and they can have more communication student's would like to work with a group, I like to work with a group because sometimes i don't know what to do so others students help me to do a great work and we all share other.",

Those were all of my reason on why the principal shouldn't make students join a other activity espcially if they don't want too.\n\nOverall,I disagree with the principal making students do a other actvity because of homework,losing sleep faster and last but not least is stress. Also studies have shown that making kids do a extra activity can contain a lot of stress and who wants to be stressing I know I don't, and it can also contain kids losing sleep do to the activities if they have homework and a activity to do it'll make the students lose sleep due to the activity and the brain needs a good hours of sleep for it to function well. This is why I say principals shoudn't make students join activies\n\nSecondly, I disagree with the principal because the students will get way more tired faster and did you know that someone in Washington DC, fainted due to the principal making the student do a other activity and thats why the principals shouldn't make students join a other activity because it'll most likely make them get tired faster and what we want is to keep our kids healthy but we can't keep them healthy if the principal makes them join a activity.\n\nLastly,my last reason is stress, stress can come from a lot of things like work,school,friends,parents,children as you see stress comes from a lot and school stress is a big oe because we all know sometimes our grades go down and when we try to bring them up it gets really stressful and espcially if your pricipal is making you do a other activity that'll make even more stress and multiple studies have shown that a lot of the stress that kids get is from school and other activies. I disagree with the principal saying that all kids should at least join one extracurricum activity because kids have other things to do like homework,they might be already doing a activity and they'll get tired faster if the principal make them do a other activity, and it can contain stress if you don't get it right the first time.\n\nFor and foremost, I disagree with the principal saying that all kids should at least join one extracurricum activity because the student have homework to do and I know that i get a lot of homework maybe you do too i also know teachers give kids projects and if the principal makes them do a extra activity then they wont be able to have anytime to do their own things",

What I mean is that students being served to vegetables which they won't take a bite of, won't make them eat because they don't enjoy eating vegetables that was served to them and might get student to not eat but starve which will be bad to there body.\n\nAdditionally, the students will be in bad shape during class time.

We all have them phase that we go through and we feel like we cant keep moving forward but why stand in the same place with that same negative attitude is going to prevent you from wanting or doing more. For example when i came to America I thought my life was over learning a whole different language and also trying to adapt to whole new country a whole different environment would be hard for me. Now we must pass SOLs to graduate but, a person who stays positive believes in there self makes it easy for their self to get through what's stop you from being happy.\n\nEveryone in life have to deal with different types of obstacles physically and mentally. Especially being a teenager people thing is not difficult to wake up every morning 6 or 7 AM and deal with people's attitude and also having to worry about the amount of work the teachers give out to students and then going home to do chorus is something that teenager are capable of doing, but adults don't take that time to think that they was teens back in the 60s where life isn't easy but when it comes to school rules have change. I also was thinking of families back home and how i cant let them down, because they would love an opportunity like this to have a free education and being able to make it to the 12 grade. For example, when it comes to school, significant others and obstacles that life may throw at us. Is important to not loose our cool and have the type of attitude that everything is going to turn out great at the end of the day.\n\nHaving a positive attitude when it come to school can be a way to cope with all your assignments, teachers and schoolmates.

In addition, when faced with difficult obstacles, those with a positive attitude can better recognize potential solutions and navigate their way to a better outcome. For example, Apple co-founder, Steve Jobs, is known for his unwavering optimism, which helped him push through the difficult times during Apple\u2019s early years and eventually led to great success. \nHaving a positive attitude is essential to success in many aspects of life, including school, relationships, and dealing with difficult obstacles in life. These stories exemplify how having a positive attitude can have a positive impact on one's life in a variety of ways.

Failure is an unavoidable obstacle, so you must be ready to affront and learn about it. The most important message to take from these quote is that after you have acknowledge both why failed and how it made you feel, you must attack the obstacle again with enthusiasm. Failure is the most important element in the pursuit of success. When you continue to fail, your learn a lot from this mistakes or problems. If everyone was to successes in their first try, we would not feel accomplished in the presence of success. See the mountain they've claimed and look to it for inspiration and all they sacrifice.\n\nIn conclusion, we come to learn more from our failures and difficulties than from our successes. Everyone who is successful has been through things that has caused them to fail in something the admired dearly, but remember you should never lose hope; mistakes allow you to view your challenge from a different perspective. I agree with Prime Winston Churchill; in he saying there is a lot of true and motivation. As Winston once said \"success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm'' This statement is most certainly true if we are welling go put in the effort to past though feature and attain real success.\n\nIf you really want something you going struggle for that and effort the most you can. Look examples about people who don't lose hope and keep trying until they did it, and see that these people are representation of success. Failure is only an opportunity to begin again, only this time with a better plan and more understanding. Failure can bring us to better ourselves and begin our plans once more, this time more wisely. Being successful is not a easy thing for anyone; there is a journey that you have to get through with many obstacles that you may fail at the first time. Success it is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all love of what you are doing or learning to do.. Also, no matter how many times you fail, you shouldn't give up on you want to do",

In each of their stories, failure acted as an opportunity to learn and grow, while perseverance enabled them to continue pressing forward on their pathways to success. Considering the stories of individuals such as Thomas Edison, JK Rowling and Steve Jobs, it is evident that failure and perseverance have been instrumental in their successes. It reminds us not to be discouraged in times of adversity and to remain dedicated to our pursuits despite the countless obstacles that may be thrown our way",

My grandmother used to say \"Your goals are not going to be done if you don't even move a finger\".\n\nI am totally agree with what Thomas Jefferson wrote about how wonderful is how much we might done if we are always doing something. On the other hand we have as example my home country, El Salvador's new president,Nayib Bukele. Then in my head I said \"if I don't get that courage to make the journey I will never going to see my parents again\" because I knew that they can't go back to my country, at the end I made that decision and I made it, I am with my parents again and as a gift I learned a new language, now I know i'll be more helpful for this country because I am bilingual now.\n\nFurthermore, we can see in every aspect of life how persons that one day were a common citizen, now are really important in the society because they were always doing something, they were working on their goals. why? Because I was afraid of the journey to be with them again, they used to tell me \"If you don't do anything you will never know how different your life could be here with us, so throw that fear away and let's do something\". Then he became a mayor because people chooses him as their mayor because of all his honest job, he started running for president in 2015, he had a hard time trying to find a political party that supports him with his new ideas and purposes for the country but the parties rejected him because they said he was to young,also they knew he was honest and that he will not admit any corrupt job that affect the country, and they were always looking for reasons to reject him, but he did not give up.\n\nFinally he made his own political party and he get the support of all the people that get tired of live in niggardliness during the governance of other parties, he fought against the two most powerful parties in our country, as a result he won the elections in 2019 and he became the new president of the nation.\n\nMany people think that it doesn't matters if you have goals and make plans for your future if you don't have some resources as money or a good social status, they can also see life as a random game which means that if you accomplish something they will say that is just luck, however; what they call luck, other people call it, late nights of doing something for what you want for your life.\n\nIn other words if you want your life to be successful, you don't have to spend your time just dreaming about what you want, because things may be done only if you are always doing something which means; work for what you want, stop thinking about your life goals and start working on them, determine yourself never to be an idler.. He was just a citizen like others but he was tired, tired of the political corruption that my country was going through, so here is what he did; he made his plan, he worked on his plan, he worked and made things for the country. We can make plans for every goal in life, but it doesn't matter if we just have a plan because we have to work in that plan to get that goal done, we accomplish a lot things more when we are doing something, when we have that determination to get things done to feel proud of ourselves.\n\nFirst of all we have to feel, we need purpose and strength to accomplish every goal in our life to feel proud in a future.

There was a fierce competition and not everyone had the talent or the dedication to make it in the industry. As well as feeling an intense sense of accomplishment, I felt a deep sense of pride in knowing that my success was entirely down to my own hard work and determination.. So for me, it was a clear choice - hard work and determination was the only way forward.\n\nI worked tirelessly with a single-minded focus, putting in 20-hour days and foregoing most luxuries in order to reach my goal.

How a about google, snapchat or even, books it all started with a imagination. Without imagination we cant think and when we cant think we cant learn or solve every day problems. Imagination is very important because with out it our lives will be more difficult for example with out cars we wont be able to go to work or go places and without phones it will be harder to communicate. It takes alot of thinking to make new and helpful things.

Imagination is the key to making new things like cars, phones, computers, books, with out imagination we wont have things like cars, or phones. Thats why imagination is vary inportant is many ways..

Together, they offer the perfect balance between theoretical thinking and practical application, allowing for a greater level of understanding and progress.. They are two sides of the same coin; one without the other would not be enough. Imagination allows us to think outside the box, to explore ideas that would otherwise be overlooked, and to find solutions to complex situations. At the same time, knowledge allows us to take our ideas and put them into practice in a tangible form. Imagination can open up the door for knowledge to be used in creative ways, allowing us to develop new theories, solve problems, explore new possibilities and come up with innovative solutions. It is this combination of imagination and knowledge that is essential to learning and development. \n\nWhen we put these two concepts together, they become even more powerful. Imagination is the power of the human mind to conceive or create images and ideas that are not based on past experience, which makes it a fundamental tool for exploration, innovation and creativity. \n\nTherefore, the importance of imagination compared to knowledge cannot be underestimated. \n\nWithout imagination, knowledge would become dull and uninspiring as it would lack the freedom of thought needed to truly propel us forward.

If you already have a plan to do something you need to think about it, before you start doing it. For example you have already done some stuff that you are not supposed to do, life is going on that does not mean you will never grow. In life, you suppose to have done the right things to continue with the others.. For this subject I do not agree with it, because if you're making mistake often that doesn't mean you will never grow up. People who does not have patient cannot make an experience without helping from someone else, and a project is not hard to make, but you have to think about what you are going to say in the project.\n\nThere are a lot of way you should find to do something, and even if you would not undertand what you are doing.

If you have an experience to do something, and prove it you need to think about it first, before you try your best in what you were trying to do. You could have done something that you had to do.

I say this is false, we are supposed to choose our character traits, and they are what makes us who we are.\n\nWe choose our own character traits. One character trait is kindness, someone who is very kind and friendly to everyone. my second character trait is rudeness, this is someone is usually not nice to others. A lot of people choose to have this as their character traits, and most have it for a good reason. My final thoughts on rudeness is that not everyone is rude, but theres always gonna be that small amount of rude people in the world.\n\nThe helpfulness trait is of my most favorite traits. A person who is helpful is like that as they have always been like that, and just want to help anyone in need. I have chosen these character traits as they are the most commonly used character traits.. My third and final character trait is helpfulness, someone who is always looking to help others. I know a lot of rude people, teachers and students, most are rude just because thats the trait they decided to choose. I chose all of these character traits, as i felt these are all traits that people choose themselves.\n\nThe act of kindness is someone who is very kind and friendly, its one of many character traits. The world is a much better place with helpful people, i hope they don't go anywhere.\n\nMy counter claim is that our character is actually formed by influences beyond our control, and that we learn from these influences what our trait really is. Some choose to be kind after seeing how some people can act so different towards other people, or their parents just simply raised them to be kind. Helpfulness is when someone who is always looking to help someone in need, and also make sure they get the help they deserve. A third example of a character trait is helpfulness, a person who wants to help others in any way. A lot of people are rude because they are most likely going through something, or thats just the trait they had growing up. I am a helpful person myself, i try to help people with their problems if i can. Not everyone is going to be a good person, some are rude all of the time for no apparent reason. This character trait is a very common character trait, and i hope more people is it in the future.\n\nRudeness is a somewhat uncommon character trait used by a small number of people.

And I disagree from experience because in my life I fail and never still had enthusiasm after failing maybe some people do but I speak from my point of view.. Once when I was playing soccer we had won all the games and then came to the day where we were playing for first place and we lost and that day all my enthusiasm was gone. Then there's failure and thats how you have success in anything from learning from your failure But there is time where when you fail and your enthusiasm is gone because of that.\n\nThe one reason I agree is because there's time that you just cant have success. If I had to take a side I think I would disagree. I was so mad and just had no energy. You feel sad and mad and just not excited no more when you keep failing again and again. From the first time you fail to the next will will learn something and later on when it happens again that's will you will get it. When you do fail and fail you lose enthusiasm but gain it back when you have success. I have had that in my life in many situations. So when you fail and fail again you will away lose enthusiasm because you just can't get it.\n\nSo if I had to pick a side I would disagree because you cant just fail and fail and then have success and not lose enthusiasm. I learned that there times that I wont win and times I will it's part of life but along the way I learn new things. Then there school there you do go from failure from failure to success because once you make a mistake and you learn from it and do better next time because your already know now but it does bring your enthusiasm down.\n\nThe next reason is that failure does does make you have success but also it make not encourage to keep going",
      "ai_text": "Instead, I understood that my attitude towards failure was what had to change. I urge us all to remember that success does not have to be preceded by failure, and to be more confident and accepting of ourselves after setbacks. It can make us feel unworthy or incapable of achieving future goals, which can harm the state of our enthusiasm. By being more aware of my expectations and being confident in myself, I was able to push forward and find success despite the failures I had faced in the past.\n\nIn conclusion, failure is not necessary to have success, and it can have a debilitating effect on enthusiasm. Depending on the individual, failure can cause us to give up and become discouraged. But does failure need to be present in order for all of us to enjoy success? Some people might argue that it does, but I disagree. Despite the life lessons that failure can teach us, it can also be detrimental to our well-being when we become too fixated on it. A few years ago, after failing the same test over and over, I felt completely discouraged and ready to give up. At this moment, I realized that failure doesn\u2019t have to be present in order to succeed. With this in mind, I argue that failure does not necessarily have to be present to have success; rather, it can stunt our enthusiasm and thus prevent us from achieving success.\n\nTo illustrate this point, I will refer to my own personal experiences. I believe that failure is not necessary to have success, and that it can have a negative effect on enthusiasm.\n\nMany of us perceive failure as a necessary part of the journey of life towards success. \nFailure is an inevitable part of life that most experience in some way. However, for many of us, failure can be a crushing blow that completely destroys our enthusiasm. This brought my enthusiasm to a complete standstill, and I felt ready to throw in the towel. That way, we can have a much better chance of achieving success.. I thought that because I failed at one task, I was incapable of achieving all my other goals. Failure teaches us lessons and sometimes strengthens our determination",

Why you didnt pass this test or why couldnt pass this quiz you took maybe if you did that homework you could have past the test , quiz also home plays a big role in school teachers give studnets homework so we can get better at that subject it easier for students not to care about homework ''BECAUSE IT DOESNT MATTER'' but it does and. We might think that homework isnt important but it is homework is worth 10 percent of your grade and sure that might not be a lot but it could really help your grade. This also will get students grades up and might take a B to and A\n\n. Also help them undestand not just give that student the answer to the question they would actually learn and that . And it could really help you like when it comes to test you could know the matrial you need for this test if you did that one piece of homework that one piece of homework could have helped you past that test you probly failed or quiz . Also some students dont understand the work the teachers give like when you dont understand that class work you were doing in that class how do the teachers expect that the student bring in there homework .\n\nI hard for students to learn middle school student have a lot to do for example students have to worry about getting homework done for all 7 of these classes it isnt easy . Also students would be happy that they got there homework done now they can do whatever they want afterschool becaus ewhat was taking up most of there afternoon is now done .. No matter how many time you try to tell yourself it doesnt matter it does and that is not going to change so do your homework and if this afterschool club happend then homework will be one less thing to worry about . I think that if the school had this club it would really help studnets in school and help really understand the work and homework and help them be less stress because it it alot of work for you to get done and espcially if you dont get the work you need to do . I think that there should be a after school homework club because its hard to understand homework sometimes and you dont know what you are doing exactly but if we were to have these clubs think about how many students would get there work done . It will not only help the students but the school to because if these student are getting there homework done then that will make the school look better . Most teachers might give more than one piece of homework some might give 2 some might give 3\n\npieces of homework .\n\nStudents could also ask about what they dont understand they will help students in what they dont understand or what they didnt understand in that lesson that they had .The teacher will explain what you didnt understand , some students just dont have time so maybe that one day that can stay afterschool could help them get all that students homework done . Teacher will also know that students are getting there work done and not just getting the anwser like some students do now when it comes to homework ",

If students are able to improve their skills as a result of involvement in the club, this can result in higher test scores, improved grades, and ultimately increase our school's reputation.

For example, we teenagers have to some activities after school or we have jobs and if its not because of those things its because were stuck in traffic.

There are a lot of bad things on the road at night and you as the driver could of course from your long drive an turn tired and maybe crash. weekday curfew and a midnight curfew for teenagers. Dear city council I find it amazing that you are doing this but I also do disagree mainly because. For example, thats when people that are under the influence are mainly on the road and depending on where you are there could be deer. In conclusion I see why you dont want us to go driving at 10PM or even past midnight because of there being dangerous things in the night but I do also hope that you know that we dont stay up because of random things but we're actually staying up important things like our jobs or after school activities and that we will be very careful in the night because we know of the dangers of the night..

And as a junior in this school,I take the position that this new dynamic idea to change the school's lunch menu is a bad idea. Also the school lunch is potentially some of the amazing healthy American foods.\n\nAgain,Most American foods are junky and cause students to gain weight chronically and gradually. So I have decided to share my thoughts for the development of this school and with our health. So principal, dont you think that changing our school's cafeteria's lunch menu is a bad idea?\n\nFor instance, our school cafeteria's lunch has got protein,Vitamin D and my weight is intact, as far as our health is concerned, so take all of these reasons into consideration and figure out your final answer,I hope that you make the right choice for the school and l know that the school's improvement is your priority.\n\nThank you respectively,\n\nGeneric_Name 11th grade( junior)                                                                                                                   . the school has got a bunch of stuff to focuse on. I have been eating our school's green salad for a while and l have seen some fantastic changes in my body and it is very impressive. American's have this quote that \" if you have lemons make lemonades\" meaning we should make the best out of what we have by embracing it not changing it.\n\nIn additon, the current school's lunch menu is technically healthy, I have this extraordinary thoughts in my mind because I haven't seen any student that has protested against the school's lunch, this means that the current school lunch is unique on it's own way. I know that my opponents would argue with me regardlessly,because they would probably assume that our students have been eating the same food for too long and would definetely want to have a different versions of food,and get to explore their school lunch like other schools usually do. But our current food consists of fruits,vegetables and also green salad which prevents the body from gaining too much weight and sustain the normal body weight. But when they detect my reasons,they would know for sure that the school's lunch is way better than they think it is.\n\nMy initial reason for not agreeing to this change is that it would eradicate some student's favorite cafeteria foods, especially me,There are a lots of food currently in the cafeteria that are so good, clean and healthy.\n\nthey are also enough food for everyone to eat, so changing the menu wouldn't be necessary, it would be a waste of time and money",

Additionally, making healthier food choices has the potential to reduce the burden on other resources such as the environment. With healthier options, students would have more nutritious meals, leading to improved health and better overall performance. \nAfter analyzing the pros and cons of keeping the current school lunch menu versus changing to a healthier one, it is clear that there would be several advantages of making the change",

That's a true statement for success, in\n\nI really Agree with Churchill's statement about the important role failure plays in the pursuit of success.\n\nIf you have a gold to be success in you though you a failure , don't like that why cause with : enthusiasm, and consists you can accomplish anything, even thing that you image you'll never accomplish or be success. Winston Churchill is a good person everybody knows that, a person that give good idea or a person that bring idea to life . Failure without trying \" does not\" gave nothing excepted discourage, in that will be stupid of you if you failure in you give up in the same time.\n\n3) Failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm will give you something in return, in that is \"fact\" no dispute about it. But the thing is, they need to get up in keep trying on till then.\n\nIf success brought people failure to failure, then what would that be in life, when you fail on try to be success, it not a bad thing cause sometime in life either you: win or you loos, but at least you can try one more time. Failure might be discourages you, but you can Always keeping going to accomplish your gold, or maybe you might \" successful\" after all.\n\n1)Success is a good thing for those who fail in fail in the results, they successful. I know some people say that too, to be success at first; you going failure to failure, in once you try not to failure guest what, you fail again. Even those who loves you can make fun of you, it they sees you keeping failure; or stay away from you on till you \"win\" or find what you want's.\n\nAnabel for you to be success you need enthusiasm, it gonna give courage, and not to focusing on you failure, then you'll never success or accomplish your gold. For example : Generic_Name his a psychology teacher in Generic_School,Generic_Name never thought he will be a teacher cause his gold was to teach psychology, unfortunately he cant past his test so that he can graduated, but he thought about it , he put all his enthusiasm on it Generic_Name past the test in now his a successful guy. There are tree reason that \" success consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.\n\nONE, if you a failure in you didn't put your enthusiasm on you \"success\" you'll never be successful.\n\nTWO, take example about people who never thought they will success, such ass Generic_Name, Generic_Name,and Generic_Name Generic_Name.\n\nTREE, always get up when fail, always focuses on you success, and take that serious when you a failure. They work hard in hard to be success cause that was their gold to be \" success\" in they accomplish it even if they fail sometime.\n\nWinston Churchill was right about that, i'm 100% agree with his statement. With enthusiasm your success going greats and fast. Winston idea was right, so my position is that success consists of going from failure to failure without loosing enthusiasm are lesson you.    . When somebody want to be success in he/she fail, that doesn't mean they cannot \" try\" again. This can be happen , but Winston was right , to success you can fail all the time. Thats it true enthusiasm try to find your success can make a big differences. Thing he say they are true, they can open your mind, and make you think.\n\nYes : I agree with Winston Churchill",
      "ai_text": "By pressing on even in the face of failure, we gain insight into what works and what doesn't, enabling us to arrive at successes that may not have been achievable had we given up in the face of adversity.\n\nEnthusiasm is also essential to the pursuit of success. We must remember, however, that failure is often part of the journey in the pursuit of success. \nWinston Churchill famously said, \"Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts\". If we possess an unshakeable enthusiasm, we can stay focused on our goals and make significant strides in achieving them.\n\nBoth failure and enthusiasm are essential part of a successful life. Failure teaches us valuable lessons that can help us to become better equipped to reach our goals. It helps to keep us motivated and inspired, and when coupled with courage, it can be a powerful tool in overcoming the challenges we inevitably encounter on our journeys. We must learn to embrace failure as part of the journey and to keep our enthusiasm alive despite challenges and setbacks. Winston Churchill's quote is a reminder of this important truth, and should inspire us to face obstacles with courage, and to stay committed to our ambitions with enthusiasm.. This quote captures the truth that failure and enthusiasm are both integral parts of the pursuit of success. Life is filled with challenges and difficult moments, and the courage to face them and the enthusiasm to drive towards our ambitions helps us to reach our goals.\n\nFailure can often be an unpleasant experience, and it can be difficult to keep our enthusiasm when failure happens",

Since It snows a lot in the winter we would be missing more days of school If winter break was longer. If we get a longer winter break we would be getting out of school later on which means less summer vacation.\n\nSince the school year is 9 months, students should get a summer break that we usually get. Students deserve the 2 months of summer break because of all the hard work and studying they did in the school year. We just had a 2 month summer break which gave the students the opportunity to be ready for the next school year and also gave them a chance to have a vacation. In the summer students also get the chance to visit family members, spend more time with their family, and even get ready for the next school year.\n\nSince we just got back into school, It is not necessary to have a one week break in the fall. Which means we would probably have a little longer school year.\n\nIf we did have a 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall, the school year would be pretty short and the students wouldn't like the short breaks. Since it snows a lot in the winter, we miss a lot of school days. Even though the educators would like it and thinks that it is helpful for students, it would make the students feel stressed out since the school year would probably be shorter.\n\nHaving regular summer break, regular winter break, and regular spring break, would be a better idea then having a shorter summer break, long winter break, and a break for spring and fall.. Students need to catch up on everything and finish lessons before the school year ends. We shouldn't have a break in the fall if we just got back into school after the long summer break.\n\nWe should not have a longer winter break. Students would be missing lessons, quizes, and even tests because of the snow days we get. Since there is also a lot of holidays in the school year, a fall break would interfere with the day we get out of school. The school year is 9 months, students should get a summer break that we usually get, which is 2 months",
      "ai_text": "Regular winter breaks also keep students out of frigid conditions and instead allows them to enjoy the comforts of home in a safe and secure environment. If this type of break were to be widespread, it could lead to significant gaps in students\u2019 education, which could negatively affect their academic performance. A longer winter break may also have a detrimental effect on the overall economy. As a result, regular summer, winter, and spring breaks are the best option for students, their families, and the overall economy.. Experts have found that longer breaks can discourage spending by students and their families, impacting businesses that rely on the additional income during this time.\n\nIn light of these considerations, the evidence overwhelmingly suggests that regular summer, winter, and spring breaks are a better idea. \nWinter is an incredibly important and popular time for breaks as it has historically been the favorite of students, parents, and teachers alike. While the idea of a longer winter break does have some advantages, the negative consequences could be significant.\n\nThe first major advantage to having a longer winter break would be the extra time students get to spend with their families and friends, creating happy memories of the holidays. Unfortunately, the problems this could cause greatly outweigh the benefits. With a longer winter break, students will miss out on vital instructional time that is crucial for their mental and social development. They provide the perfect balance between academic development and leisure activities so students can go back to school feeling energized and ready to start a new semester. However, the past few years have seen an increase in extreme and often dangerous snow storms, which has led some to consider a longer winter break, but at the expense of shorter summer and one-week fall and spring breaks. Regular breaks give students the opportunity to learn, participate in recreational activities, and create long-lasting memories during these times",

Additionally, in-person interactions provide a profoundly different experience than doing most activities online. \nTechnology has revolutionized many aspects of our lives, and its impact on physical and mental health, communication in relationships, and the benefits of in-person interaction is undeniable. Too much reliance on technology can create a disconnect between people and their physical environment, leading to decreased empathy and social skills, less physical activity, and greater disconnection with the real world.. Interacting with someone in person provides an emotional and sensory connection that can\u2019t be replicated with technology, such as meeting with a friend to discuss a problem, or purchasing an item in a store and being able to physically inspect it. The role of technology in communication in relationships can also be significant",
      "instructions": "Task: Task:\n1. Research the potential impact of technology on physical and mental health.\n2. Investigate the effects of technology on communication in relationships.\n3. Examine the benefits of interacting in person compared to using technology to purchase items.\n4. Analyze the consequences of relying too heavily on technology instead of face-to-face interaction."

      "human_text": "If you think of always being occupied and being successful it practically the same concept just because getting task done is like you doing anything you are asked to do and being successful is like achieving your goals.\n\nSecondly, Idle and inactivity serves a purpose when you are a 100 percent sure you can do anything when asked to. By all means that by being idle you wont get much done, but if active can get a lot of more stuff done. it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing\". Others belive that by being idle, you can still get anything done as much as a person that is consistently active. For example my dad once told me, why are you always playing video games and that why dont i go and play outside with my friends. Going to the Gym doesnt only show that you have an excellent daily routine but you are person that has a goal to complete each and every day. Inactivity and idleness is not good because by not having anything to do you wont learn as much as a person that has to do majority of time. Theres no task to difficult or no job to big for you to complete because you are already used of always doing something in your everyday life and while being idle from the task isnt part of your expectation or motives. Likewise, many people belive that \" Determine never to be idle ... Although i wasnt good, i started trying my best and being active with the team. What i told him was that i did not want to and he told me that my actions show a lot about who i am. It will be less likely for one to not complete a task or struggle with a task if is idle. What he also had suggested to my dad was if he can move me up to a left forward because of all the hard work and commitment i had done for the pass warm ups and practice games.\n\nTherefore, people that are always participating you will see improvement in grades, work ethic and body structure. By always having something to do, your showing everyone your character and your morals. People that always are doing something productive in there everyday life have good grades because they are used of finishing all their work, rather then the student that doesnt do anything and idled from the class. By showing everyone you always have something to do, your showing them that you are capable of doing anything. Inactive people show their lack of interest and the type of attitude shown. Humans that are always active rather than being idle and isolated have a better attitude and work experience. While a person that is consistently doing things and keeping there self occupied and does not tend to complain about what they are ever asked to do. I strongly agree that by being active will get more tasks complete and it will be less difficult. Later that day my coach was talking to my dad and telling him how i was participating and doing everything he told me to do. Always doing stuff will make you want to complete more each and every time.. Always doing something no matter if you have nothing to do, shows a lot about someones motivation and actions. Keeping your self occupied thew out any circumstance is a good skill and shows that you are not inactive and that nothing is excluding you from doing anything you have to do.\n\nIn conclusion, do you think always having something to do all the time shows who you really are? Participating shows a lot about a person goals and achievements. Especially in a work place, if your boss sees you doing nothing while there being things to do, hes going to think your inactive. After that he signed me up for a youth soccer team, that i played being a defender. Actively participator have better improved skills then those who dont do anything.\n\nFirstly, being active is the best goal a mind set can have",
      "ai_text": "If a person fails to stay motivated and productive, they risk remaining stagnant in their personal progress and achievements. Therefore, it is imperative for people to strive to stay engaged in activities that shape and inform their lives, allowing them to grow in a meaningful way.. These positive outcomes are often more tangible than those that come with idleness. In a workplace setting, those who demonstrate a willingness to contribute are seen as motivated and committed to their work, providing an example to colleagues and potentially resulting in rewards and recognition. \n\nThere are a number of notable cases of individuals whose lives have been improved by actively engaging in activities. Active lifestyles, in comparison to idle lifestyles, offer numerous advantages that encourage physical, mental, and emotional growth. \nStaying actively engaged and participating in activities has been linked to many positive results, ranging from physical health benefits to improved mental wellbeing",

Has the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology had positive or negative effects on people's lives? Yes, people using technology on everyday bases can have negative effects on thier lives. using your phone can alow you to do things like: order clothes, buy eddibles, talk with family and friends all over the world, watch movies, listin to music, playing games, remembering birhdays, and things you have to do in your long term plan. Getting things done just by your phone can make your life easier and stress free. The technology that they have can alert and get the help the person needs without the person having to call or touch anything. For example, looking into your screen for long period of time can have negative effects on your eyes. eventhoght technology has negative effects on you, sometimes technology can have positive effects on you and your everyday life.\n\nFor example, technology can help you keep and complite taskes in your everyday life. Being on your phone everyday limits your time of socialing and having regular converstion with other people. They can use it at home to do homework and study. some are using technology to make new inventions such as, self driving cars to make the world a better and safe place.\n\nFor students technology is very helpful they can use it in school to take tests, quizes, and classwork. use it to reserch and watch visualy watch videos to help them understand things they don't know. help them communicate with teachers and other helpful resorces online. For home schooled students technology is very helpful, beacuse some student are able to learn and understand better if they got lessons online than in a classroom.\n\nMoreover, technology is a very helpful thing it might have negative effects on you and your life if you use it in the wrong way but its very helpful in some cases, and people actually need technology to learn and live. technology isnt bad or have negative effects on you its the way you use technology.. In some cases technology is used more then to just watch movies and remebering birthdays, its used to save lifes and make new inventions.\n\nFor instance, older people with health problems use technology everyday, they depend on technology to safe thier lives. technology can make you develop an ediction with your phone, video game, and computer making you unawere with what's happeing around the world. people around the worls are using technology to help and make cure for people with health issues",

On the other hand, technology has allowed us to accomplish tasks more efficiently and widened our access to information and resources. Technology has enabled advancements that allow seniors to monitor their health and access medical assistance remotely while also connecting them to family members or caregivers. \nTechnology has become a ubiquitous part of modern life, impacting us both positively and negatively. Overuse of electronics can be damaging to a person's physical and mental health, leading to eyestrain, headaches, and poor posture. \n\nStudents also reap the rewards of technology, as increased access to computers and the internet means they can access information and resources more easily than ever before. Additionally, too much screen time can have a detrimental effect on social and emotional development. \n\nOne area in which technology is seen as especially beneficial is in helping older people to manage their medical needs",

We can keep making things and accomplish our goals that can be done by not quiting and always keep doing something to make a change because who knows what we can accomplish and how we can make an impact on how our next generation is going to be like if we always keep doing something. We can make it better for all the generations that comes after us by keep on doing something to shape and preserve our society. Thomas Jefferson wrote that ''determine never to be idle'' which means that always be determined to do something to help shape our society into something more and better and to never lack your worth. Therefore we accomplish a lot more when we keep doing what we do now a lot can be done, if we keep making an impact our future is going to keep chaging into something more better then how we live now, having always something to do serves a huge purpose.. It can make a huge impact on how we live now and how our future is going to look like and how is it going to be like if people would've been inactive. A lot of things can be done when we do something instead of being inactive and doing nothing to help with our society because when we do nothing it has a much bigger effect then actually doing something, we could all be out on the streets probably with no job or even a house to live in because it was never invented because of the many people that were inactive in the past. We would've been out there living on the streets with no houses all because people were being inactive back then and not build anything that can help shape our future.\n\nWe all have a certain unique skill set we can use to help our world and make our society a better place then what it is now. We probably would've been living like how the great depression was back then but a lot worse because there would'nt be any people working or there would'nt be any cars or even houses and buildings because people were inactive this could lead to all of us being poor. Everything that we built and invented would'nt be here in this generation or the next one. We already accomplished so much because of the people in the past did something and they always kept doing something to actually make a huge difference to what the future will look like. But do we really accomplish more if we are always doing something to help shape our future or can inactivity also serve a purpose as well?

Groups also provide a safe space where students can ask questions without feeling embarrassed or intimidated. \nWorking in groups could be both beneficial and productive for both the students and the teachers. The different activities and collaborative work in groups can help students to better understand the material, while the different teaching methods used can engage the students and make the learning process more enjoyable.. For teachers, groups can be a great way to keep the students engaged - it encourages students to participate in the lesson and become part of the process, rather than passively listening to a lecture.\n\nUsing group work also allows for different teaching styles and methods to be used by the teacher, like simulations, group games, and problem-solving activities. Groups can make it easier for college students to learn and comprehend difficult material, because they can collaborate on ideas, provide different solutions, and work together to come up with the best answer",

      "human_text": "so lets say some students like school and want to get to the higher level.\n\ni'm sure that they have families and have to rest. we need a longer break so we can recover form school stress and spend time with our family, school now last for 10 month and summer vacation last for 2 months and a half, so we should leave it like that.\n\nThird thing is taking off one week off spring break and fall break is really a bad idea, why because we need to have some rest and some fun. Summer vacation also give us the opportunity to get a job and save money, two months is pretty enough to get you at least much money. School start in September and finish in June so, when we will have a year of school we will be finishing in August that make 12 months of school, so where is the summer vacation break.\n\nso some people might disagree with me, but i think that what we should do is change the school system. we need time to do all those stuff and make our life better, when we come back from summer vacation. you will be able to do other think than just memorizing stuff you don't need in a real life, that's why it's not a good idea to reduce students summer break just because educators say so, we need to have some fun and start learning new stuff about the path we want to take in our life.\n\nFirst of all taking a long summer break will restore ourselves, it will change our personally there might be people that are devastated from getting bullied at school, some people that have stress and don't want to talk about it and need some time to think about it, some that fail the SOL,and are failing a class, and never want to repeated again, or get ready for summer school, some that need to get ready for the next school year. what, that's insane, we are going to do a year at school and get only a total of 1 months off out of 12 months what, no, that is a bad idea, if we get a year of school , how are we going to get 3 week or 4 week of summer vacation there will be no summer vacation. Some students that take care of themselves need to have more time to get ready for the next school season, so they can buy what they need such as: school supplies,clothes, ETC..... school is not our family but home, the only reasons most students come to school this day are to make new friends.\n\nSecond think school is worthless, we dont need to go to school for that long what we need is to work hard to achieve our dream, and have some fun with life, that's all we need, and if we stay in school for a year and spend less time at home, we will not be able to communicate well with our family, this is not a good idea, there are people that went to school, and got their high school diploma, went to college for 2 years, and are still working at McDonald for few money, that means they just waste a lot of time at school this whole year and didn't get any good from it, so if we stay at school for a year, we will then spent 12 year getting educated, and still not achieve our dream, still going to have a job at a fast food restaurant. Summer vacation is a good break for the students to spend time with their family, also a good way to take a break form school and your annoying classes, to take some rest, change your mind, and think about what will you change, when you go back to school, also taking a long summer vacation will get yourself out of stress. we can say math might help you a bit, but not everybody want the same things, also not getting a long break will weaken our brain.\n\nEvery country have the same system break as us, not all but at least FRANCE has the same as the U.S, by changing our break time it might affect other countries, students will have more stress and will not have fun at home with their family, parent might also complain about changing the break and going to school for a year, by the way every time we come for a new school season we learn new things and different things, At least half of what we learn just come in some of the topic, we will not have the same class as last school season, but new one and new different topic, you will only have the same stuff to learn, if you fail the class or if you the SOL in that class, and that's why we need a longer break so we can focus more on that in the break time and won't fail no more next school season.\n\nFamily over school, family is the most important thing, i'm don't know anyone that dont like his families members, so let's said that we should not reduce the school break, or go to school for one year, we should also change the school system so we can put students in what they are trying to become the future they want to build, the future might need more people that could do a lot of different stuff, we might need help for, then let's agree that going to school for one year is not worth it for some students and reducing the summer vacation is a bad idea.. for example; let's take a place of a student that want to be a athlete, and is learning math, science, economics, and other stuff for 12 years without getting any lessons from the the types of athlete he want to be, so that's kind of bad and not good, why because getting educated for something you don't have any interest in or you don't like at all, it's not good. who want that, no one want a week off spring break and also a week off fall break. summer vacation need to be long enough so we can spend time with our family",

Although reducing summer break could provide students with more of an opportunity for class instruction, it is important to weigh the negatives that come with it. \nStudies have shown that in the United States, students from kindergarten to twelfth grade have received systematic instruction of less than 10 months a year with short summer vacations in between. \n\nWhen considering the pros and cons of a 10-month school year, it is best to look at the harmful and helpful advantages to students. Long summer breaks are often seen in other countries, with some countries dedicating up to 11 months of consecutive instruction. \n\nTherefore, when considering these factors, it is important for school systems to take into account the student\u2019s dreams and life aspirations.

I think that this is a good example why we should used cell phones in classrooms, so we can use them in a correct way thinking about our grades.\n\nI also think that we should used cell phones for projects. This is my friend called Generic_Name he is 17 years old we are friends from middle school. having in mind that a lot of people will not agree,but cell phones are helpful. I agree with the assertion of using cell phones in classrooms.\n\nThose who believe, that cell phones should not be allowed in classrooms,have their reasons,for example they believe that cell phones are distracted, in a way that students can't control it. After that,all the students got their own computers,but there were not enough for everyone,so we had no computers next,we asked the teacher can we used our cell phones,for the project she asked if there were no more computers and we said no not more,so with no choice the teacher said yes,used your cell phones,but only for the project,without wasting time we got our phones out,and we started working on our new project we worked in our cell phones as we had computers after the hard work we stopped,because the bell ring. If cell phones should be allowed in classrooms,or cell phones should not be allowed in classrooms.. While, some students are distracted others are taking an advantage of it. cell phones will provide a better understanding to all the students in all schools We should reflect about it, and came up with our own position. I said no you don't have to explaining me nothing, just give me the vocabulary i will look it up in internet,and i will write down the meaning of each word i will be quiet,so you can keep doing what you doing. They are important. In this time we were in government class, once again the teacher gave us a group activity in this case we had to came up with a new country, otherwise invent country,so we had to give it name,where it will be located, and the rulers for its country. We can learn more about any topic, an example of this can be,if the teacher is explaining something and i don't understand instead of asking him. Although some say that cell phones should not be allowed in classrooms. Actually it should be allowed in classrooms,for research purpose and projects during class. This is another proof why cell phones are important they are really helpful in many different s ways we used all cell phones,for the whole project and thanks to that we turned in our project on time.\n\nIn conclusion,we should all used cell phones in classrooms for research purpose and projects. They also think that cell phones are addictive. I can go to internet and find out. However,that is not true because we all can control our self, and i think that if we use our cell phones in a corresponding way, we will not only learn more, we will improve our skills and in the future become professional in anything.\n\nI believe that we should used cell phones for research purpose,for example i remember when i was in English class i got sick, and i had to go to the doctor when i came back, to school the teacher was giving directions for our next assignment,but in that moment i felt like i was out a lot of days,but no it was only 2 days out of class,so i said to him I feel like i had miss a lot of thing just let me know what i need to do, and i will try to do everything that i need,so he said we went over more vocabulary, but right now i am explaining something, if you want to do it you have to stay after school i will be happy to help you. all the things that i need to learn and with examples. He said fine. technology is here for us,so we can take an advantage, and use it like it is for our own purpose",

Both sides have valid arguments, and teacher should consider the needs of their particular classroom before implementing a policy.. \n\nUltimately, it is up to schools to decide if and how to allow cell phones to be used in the classroom. Allowing phones can draw students' attention away from lessons, and give them an avenue to access distractions like social media and gaming apps during class.

      "human_text": "One of minister Winston Churchill most famous quotes is \"success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm\". Some people think that most people are consists on going with failure as a way that shows us that most people end up with failure again. They feel that it's true most people end up failing and end up doing the same process over and over again. I believe that most of the people should believe that success can be achieved only if you try but you will end up failing some of the times because first reason some people give up so easily and second reason they'll never give it their best some of the times and final reason is that people end up saying \"it's too difficult\".\n\nFirst reason is that people most of the times end up giving up is because of the lack of things such as work or other sorts of jobs it could also be anything in life that people will give up on. you'll need to give it your best and try to give it all you got it could be on a test or it could also be on another problem in life by doing this you could achieve on being successful and end up doing great with no struggle or bad choices.\n\nFinal reason is that people end up saying that \"it's to difficult\" but by showing this people can make it difficult on themselves by not focusing or doing what your supposed to it can be in some situations where you have difficult times but in the end if you end up following direction or staying on task it could led to having a successful accomplishment.\n\nAs you have read that people should have any other way but to be always successful and always trying your best, you will end up failing but it's always good to never giving up. It could be like saying it's a job and your been stressing out so much that you couldn't take it anymore so you decided to just call it quits, but for this problem people should always try there best and never let any other problems get into the way of their accomplishment, all ways stay positive and never lose on what you enjoy like giving up on it.\n\nSecond reason could be is that people don't ever try giving it their best it's always a been a problem cause some of the times people end up saying i'm not going to even try. On that day will we ever have to worry about failing.. Only when will we ever end up failing that will always find a way to end up doing it correctly",
      "ai_text": "His example shows that success is possible, and that no matter how many times failure occurs, success can still be accomplished by channeling enthusiasm and never giving up.. \n\nIt is essential to never give up and stay enthusiastic despite whatever struggles may occur. \nMany successful individuals have triumphed despite innumerable failures. His determination and enthusiasm allowed him to change non-believers into believers and to achieve success. For example, if an individual can focus on learning each failure, then develop a method or strategy to attain success, he/she can conquer any challenge that they might encounter. As long as a person stays focused and focused on their own enthusiasm, they will continue to try and have an optimistic outcome.\n\nMichael Jordan\u2019s story is a great demonstration of how success can still be achieved despite failure. Take the famous basketball player Michael Jordan for example. These qualities can help anyone achieve anything, even those individuals who may have felt that their ultimate goals and dreams were impossible. His skill techniques, knowledge of the game, and his hard work and dedication were the factors that enabled him to achieve success. Despite being cut from his high school basketball team, he remained enthusiastic and kept practicing until he moved forward and eventually became one of the best in the world",

We can keep all our important documents and photos in the cloud, meaning we don\u2019t have to worry about losing them if our hard drive decides to crash.

Also, since many people are now using technology to pay bills, it can be easier to overspend, as we no longer have the physical reminder of cash being taken out of our wallets.\n\nWhen it comes to society, technology has done a lot of good. We no longer need to leave our homes to pay bills or shop for groceries, as we can easily do it all online. The internet has enabled people to access previously unavailable information, meaning they are more informed and can make better decisions. People can become isolated if they spend too much time on their digital devices, leading to problems with communication. \n   Technology has rapidly become a vital part of our everyday lives.

For the first day, the manager just wants him to do some work likes buy the coffee, copy papers... If a person being themselves then they just want to do anything they know and do not care another person. When they look at another people they can learn more lessons and experiences in life. However, they live in the modern world and have many things to worries. Some of them just live and do anything they like when they success. So, he knows work to lives, not lives to work. He recognizes that help him too much to create more skills and learn more experiences.\n\nThus, people should not being themselves are great accomplishment. Absolutely, he knows what he wants to do. Some people want to become another one to success. That make they think if they should being themselves or not. So, we know that many people are accomplishment by their own decision but only for who are smart or brave challenge themselves. However, not being themselves should not change the physical world. Some people they never change their life, and they just live by the rules. Also, they can not do anything they like while living with their family before. Although people have their own decision, people should not being themselves are great accomplishment because sometime they need to change and over time people have done the tasks they hate.\n\nFirst of all, people have their own decision. For example, a man who has a dream that he can travel around the world. He always thinking about it but he can not. Because he just graduation and he wants to become the employer in this company. So, people should not being themselves because they do not know exactly about themselves. He hopes it will make his life better and can complete his dream later.\n\nAlso, sometime they need to change. They want to do with something else. When they go out to work they need to follow all the rules of the life. So, he put his dream on the side and focuses on the job. Just do the best they can and maybe they can accomplishment if not being themselves.. Because he know it is a modern world and has many things to do and worries. So, they force to finish it while they do not like. Of course, they will feel boring and nonsense.

To go against expectations and pursue the path you really want to be on is a brave choice to make, but it is also necessary for a fulfilling life.

Not easy for a young boy or girl to know what they going to decide to do for the rest of their life, specifically when they haven't discovered what life is like. Student have to do other stuff not only thinking about careers they want to take, students have to do homework, some students have to help their parents and get a job to help them some students love to do sport. What is the best? We'll figure out. Big Responsibility Young Age\n\nIn most common societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they ending high school but in some societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter school. Students also need help and time to know what they want for the rest of their life. When my parents told me this I felt so peaceful and relax because I had time to see what career I\n\nwant to take and I had time to get information about careers that were interesting for me. Young people have to do it carefully because their future depends on their decisions on the present.\n\nIt's hard for a students to decide what they want for they life for instance when I was at 9 grade my parents told me, if you don't know what career you want to take it's fine you have 4 years to decide. And I could do better at school because I didn't have to keep thinking about careers that I want for my life because I could do that in my free time.\n\nIn conclusion if a student it's a really young age let them think what they want not only because it's at young age it's also because they going to pick something that it's for the rest of their life. The only way that you could decide what career you want being a early age it's with help of God.",

My advice to young people who are trying to figure out what career path to follow is to talk to mentors, explore different opportunities, and trust that you can make decisions that will help shape your future..

I don't Speak and understand English. Because they think that we are not good at this. peoples who are around them they need to help them motivate them so they can try it again.

There have been times when I've been close to giving up, only to find that the steps I took to change my perspective ultimately paid off. When someone is afraid of failure, the best way to motivate them is to remind them that failure can be a lesson in the journey and that it shouldn't stop them from trying to reach their goals.

Football players dont just get to be star just like that they gotta earn it. One day the coach pulled me after practice and told me what's up this is not the kid I saw play football in Miami Beach. Do you agree with Churchill statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success? Yes because in order for you to be successful you have to fail a couple of times. We were still up than theres the halftime coach talks to the players even I did so and they go back on the field we are on the 40 yard line and next thing you know boom are star quarter back is hit. . After that coach went outside mad he was really mad and he then saw the score board it said 28-7. We went to playoffs and finished 5-0 coach was really happy in 10 years of coaching he had never achieved something like that with his football team. He is not getting up his spine was broken and he could not even move after that coach knew we lost the game but coach did not know that i was feeling better without coach knowing i wen't back on the field the score is 28-28 theres 30 second left and the ball is on the 50 yard line. My brothers always told me if you eat okay now you will eat better tomorrow it is a saying just about being able to actually grind and stay humble. We were up 21-7 its second half 2 minutes before half and next thing you know I had both tight ends and safety hit me at the same time both tight ends hit me in my knee and I was done. Rappers dont get to get platinum just like that they gotta make good songs. For an example when\n\nI was 10 years old I lived in Miami Florida and I played football. Now i am 17 and i learned from my passed i learned from being a failure for you to be able to be great you gotta fail no matter what nobody is perfect. Every kid I went up against they were faster than me and better and I got mad because I was not good enough. you can feed a horse but you cant force them to eat it. Coach knows I came from a rough spot in Miami especially the projects. Everything in life is a sacrifice you gotta humble yourself and be able to go out and get it because nothing will be bought to you. sometimes in life things will not always be easy because that is just the way things are and i personally will be better from yesterday.\n\nHow do you think all the star people from now and days have so much money they were not good from the jump they failed a lot in life nothing will never come easy to be great you gotta beat the great. What hurt the most was seeing my coach not being able to concentrate he had then even left the special team coach run the plays all because coach went to check on me.\n\nHe asked the doctors was I okay and they said he is done he cant play neither can he walk. He then matched me up with the best receiver he had and I still didn't surprise him with that kid he saw on the beach.\n\nAfter a while of training and training back to back coach then matched us up again now I was faster and better it got to the point where I was his star receiver that season we finished 10-0. Coach starts to see the formation he than knew I was on the field and he tried calling timeout but there was no time out left coach knew I could throw but the team did not know my friend Ricky is running he cuts back and runs back up the field as fast as he can I throw the ball he catches it on the 10 yard line and he gets the touchdown coach than ran on the field and picked me up.\n\nCoach then said how did u manage to hold in all the pain after being hit like that I told him the same way my brother managed to cover me when there was a drive by and he was shot 9 times",

My own experience is a testament to this: I failed my first attempt at university, but this only motivated me to work harder and eventually I graduated with honors.\n\nMoreover, many successful historical figures have gone through significant amounts of failure before achieving greatness. Without failure, people lose the motivation to make the necessary changes in order to achieve success. Likewise, Oprah Winfrey was formerly fired from a job due to her race, yet she went on to become one of the most successful TV talk show hosts.\n\nThese examples demonstrate that failure is often a necessary part of success.

However, some other students get tired of chasing a career they once dreamed of, that they change every school year and get lazy or dont care anymore.\n\nAnother disadvantage would be that students only concentrate on their future careers and focus on their difficult classes they take, and this might sound confusing because, that is the reason why students go to school, however only focusing on work doesn't mean it's healthy for a young teenager. Some teenagers have planned to go to college after high school and some have planned to start with a job. However, there are also many young teenagers that already identified a career that they want to follow, it pretends on how the young boy or young girl acts, motivation and working speed.\n\nIt would be better to give the young teenagers a little bit more time to think about the future and maybe to just let them experience new things and learn more about our societie, so at the end they have a clearer view on what is going on and what they maybe will be in the future, so they can better prepare themselves. Making friends will also be a lot easier, because the students in the same class will have the same interest and maybe the same opinion.\n\nChoosing a specific career that they want to follow, at a young age is big step, in fact it's maybe a to big of step for a young teenager. Students can better concentrate on specific class to help them and guide them towards their dream career, of course there are other classes that have to be taken, in able to graduate however, students still have the opportunity to chose specific classes. The reason why is because, they will have more fun working on something that their interest in then working on other class work. However, after time passes, students will learn and experience new stuff in school and out of school, and they might get to know different intreset, and opinions of their friends and classmates. Another problem would be that the young teenager will have difficulties making friends or has difficulties to talk to other classmates about anything besides school. Starting as a freshmen in high school, students have a big and a open mind to almost everything and so they think they already know what they want to do after high school. Taking school not seriously is not the point here, however taking school work too serious \"For the good of the students future\" can cause serious damage in important relationships, such as the relationship between a child and his or her parents could be damaged because, the child has to much pressure on his or her mind and if his or her parents interrupt, a fight between parents and child would break out.

Those were my .. In fact, many students already know what they want to do after school and appreciate the opportunity to chose specific classes. Besides having a great opportunity to get helped and prepared for their future, is that young teenagers will have more fun in class that in regular class. By the time the young child gets older, it's interest changes in many categories such as their dream job. However, the optional courses should not be change and they should be stay like that because, they are very helpful and perfect to prepare and guide the students towards their dream career.\n\nAs we all can see there are many pros and contras to this subject that could be disgust and argued about. Therefore, some students will change their courses over and over again, till they final identified a career that they really like, and enjoy. However, there are also some teenagers that dont have any future plans and they dont care about it. Of a young child, it's dream career is to become a policemen or policewomen, firemen or firewomen, a actor or actress or even an astronaut. The reason why is because, they don't like that the schools expects students to identify a career by the time they enter high school, saying that the schools should give the young teenagers time to experience and learn new things before they have to chose what they want to be in the future.\n\nHowever, not all students feel the same way as the other students. That's why some parents disagree with today's societies. In today's societie, Schools expect students to identify a career by the time they enter high school.

One of the primary drawbacks is that, although teenagers may have a clear idea of what they want to do, they may not take into account any personal and professional changes that may occur as they enter adulthood. \n\nIn conclusion, while deciding on a career path in teenage years can give young people a significant advantage, there are potential risks in making this decision too early. While there are some advantages to deciding on a career at an early age, there are some potential drawbacks that should be considered. It is important for teens to consider their options carefully and think about the potential upsides and downsides before committing to a specific career path.. Teens who pursue this approach are also likely to have a greater clarity regarding their career choices when they become adults. Additionally, teens can often become so focused on one career that they miss out on various other opportunities, especially if the chosen career path doesn\u2019t work out",

Even in the movie no one likes the the bad character because they are mean, bad, and no good to others but to harm them and put them in danger. A coworker of mine was very rude to customers. For example if my brother speaks to others in a good manner people will always respect him. Other people may say its hard for us to choose our character traits because we are not able to, however for some people it's hard but the things that a person does in their everyday life those things chooses their character it determines if they have a good character or not. Most people that we don't know how to choose our character traits, therefor choosing a good character do not need any special skills. All a person has to do to have a nice character they have to dress properly they need to have good manners and don't be rude to others and this is all it takes to have a good character. Everyone chooses their own character no matter if you are small or big. Being nice and respecting others will represent a good character of you. Having a good character shows that you are a good person, but if you decide to have a bad character people no longer will trust you and you will be worthless to others, so this is why we choose our own character.\n\nWe choose our own character because our character is based on how we interact with other people. people can present themselves as neat person by the way how they dress in public or anywhere else.                           . A few years ago my uncle was invited to a wedding party but he wasn't sure what to wear, however some some of his friend told him to wear something casual but that didn't fit his character because he was a boss of a company, therefor many of his coworker would see him there so he decided to wear a suit because it was best for his character.\n\nWe choose our own character by the way how we talk to other people. A persons character is based on their personality. It is very easy for someone to change their character, whatever you choose to be that will be your character. Having a good character is very important in our everyday life, furthermore having a good personality will also effect a persons character so in order to have a better character you need to have a good personality.\n\nSome people say that we can't choose our character because it's beyond our control, however choosing your character is not hard you just need to have a good personality and have to be nice to others. One day a customer complained to the manager about how he was being rude to her, so the manager decided to fire him from his job.\n\nWe choose our character based on how we dress. Some people dont have a good character and that's why people neither wants to trust them or talk to them. Its easy for people to choose a character for themselves either a good or a bad character. If a person has a job interview and he wants to look good then he has to wear a dress that fits his character and makes him that he wants the job",
      "ai_text": "For example, if someone is wearing bright colors and interacting boisterously, they may be categorized as irresponsible. It should be noted that having a good character is not only beneficial for the individual, but also those around them. Oftentimes, people make snap judgments based solely on the way somebody interacts with others or what they\u2019re wearing on any given day. \n\nIt is for these reasons why having a good character is essential in everyday life. \nIn this day and age, it is important to take the time to carefully consider one\u2019s own character traits and the implications that they can have. . In order to ensure that each person is in their best possible state of mind, it is important to take the time and effort to work on the self and improve their character. Friends and family can be more confident in the trustworthiness of the person, and colleagues can potentially become more productive as a direct result. It\u2019s important to remember that these characteristics are skills, and a person must actively work on honing their character in order to become a better person. On the other hand, someone in a more toned-down ensemble and keeping to themselves may be perceived as introverted or shy. It is important to consider that these assumptions are not always accurate, and that each person\u2019s character is unique to them. \n\nHaving a \u201cgood character\u201d is a term often used to describe those with admirable traits, such as being honest, generous, and respectful. Acquiring these skills can help minimize conflict or difficult social interactions, and can make living a happy and successful life much easier",

These students may end up feeling exhausted and demotivated, which could lead to a decrease in their academic performance. It can also allow schools to introduce enrichment activities such as field trips, robotics, music, and art.

But you can still attend online class if you're sick. This allows students to have more energy which will help them focus on their work and be more productive in class. Also that it's easier to cheat on test's and quiz's in online classes then it is to cheat in school, because the teacher dosen't know what your doing on.\n\nThat is my reasoning on why taking online classes is more beneficial then going to school. You can also attend online classes while on vacation with a laptop you'll rarely have missing work to do which is a big positive for improving your grades.\n\nHowever, some may argue that looking at the bright screen for a extended amount of time will put a strain on your eye's. Online school can be more beneficial to a lot of student's struggling with grades and being late to school because of over sleeping or missing the bus. Some students also have trouble with over sleeping due to a lack of sleep causing them to miss the bus and be late to class. Going to school takes up a lot of time off stuff you're interested in doing outside of school like playing sports and spending more time at home.\n\nI agree with online classes over going to school because some students feel more comfortable learning in their house rather then going to school.

The convenience of online classes is twofold; on the one hand, they can be taken from anywhere without the need to catch a bus or spend time commuting, plus students can attend class when they are sick and don\u2019t have to worry about being marked absent or behind in their curriculum.

      "human_text": "And again,students finds it very boring when learning on their own because there is no form of oral conversation between the teacher and student. Because they encounter a lot of problems in their studies. So when all of this happens , students may be delayed which will cause them to fail and waste of time. So what he does is to off the computer and go to bed. With these,it makes student lazy and sleepy when he or she sits in fronts of the computer to learn. They will distracted either by their cell phones or electronic devices. And me myself is experiencing this problem. When school closes, I have to walk half a mile before I gets home,and from there,I work on my assignments and take my shower. I feel tired in learning at times which retards my level of learning.\n\nFrom these reasons, I would like to conclude that,students would not benefit from distance learning because there are so many disadvantages from it which has brought low level academics in their studies.\n\nThank you.. And we all know students always like to be on their cell phones at anytime and anywhere. For instance,I had a friend who was struggling with these same problems,he feels bored and difficult to understand in distance learning. Also,Students can be distracted either by their parents or siblings which may cause them lack behind ahead of their lessons. Offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing by schools is a good idea, but I take a position on this issue to say that, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes classes from home due to the following reasons.\n\nFirst of all,some students when offered distance learning will not pay attention to their lessons. Students finds it very hard to understand lessons without the presence and explanation of a teacher. Some students even have to close work after school before taking the online class. For example,my cousin came to the United States of America with his siblings and he was permitted to to take one of his subjects or courses online. Some students prefer being active in studies rather being dull or inactive. So by the time I will be done,then it is getting late, and I still have to take this classes online. So when all these happens,the students may skip the contents because he or she doesn't get any understanding,\n\nor close the contents and go to sleep. Due to this,he fell apart in his studies which caused him to fail the course.\n\nAnother reason is that,some students finds it difficult and boring to learn on their own pace. So anytime he gets to sit for the lessons,he feels sleepy during a short period of time. And this hinders his academic performance each year.\n\nLastly,students feel fatigue or weak in distance learning since they don't get time to take rest after school. He sometimes drink a whole cup of thick coffee but it doesn't make any changes. And anytime he gets home,he doesnt get a peace of mind because of the disturbances and worries from his siblings",
      "ai_text": "However, it is important to consider that students may not be able to benefit fully from this style of learning.\n\nThe main issue is that this environment is full of potential distractions. \nDistance learning may have its advantages for those who are unable to attend physical classes due to challenging family or work commitments. The potential for multiple distractions, lack of teacher guidance and added stress of regular study on their own, can create difficulties for learners who are looking to excel in their chosen field.. Without the support of their teacher, the individualised guidance needed to fully understand concepts or problems might be lacking. Students may be easily tempted by electronic devices or the company of their parents, siblings or friends. This can lead to them feeling disengaged with their education, and reluctant to continue to learn.\n\nFinally, due to the lack of a physical break in a technician's routine, fatigue can easily impair their concentration and performance. Without physical activity, regular breaks and structure, students may feel overwhelmed or exhausted by having to make it through the day, which can lead to issues with maintaining mental and physical health.\n\nIn conclusion, despite some advantages, distance learning does not necessarily provide an ideal environment for students who wish to focus on their studies. This means that much of their attention is potentially not focused on school work, which can have a detrimental effect on their progress and educational attainment.\n\nAnother concern is that some students may find distance learning dull, and struggle to concentrate and learn on their own",

Times are different since the introduction of digital devices in education, and children may struggle to focus on tasks and activities so long into the day. Having a longer school day means more homework for students and puts greater pressure on them. \n\nReason 1: We are already in school for 8 hours and it is too much. Students and their families may find it almost impossible to juggle appointments, such as counseling, medical, and a range of other services in and around a longer school day. While some argue that extending school days would have educational and social benefits, I am against the idea of adding one and a half hour to school days. Eight hours is already a long time to spend in school. Such appointments are crucial, and an impossibly long school day could lead to missed opportunities for numerous students",

      "ai_text": "Mental health researchers now suggest heavy use of technology can lead to a range of mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety and attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder. Here are five reasons why I disagree with the increased use of technology in my life. By shutting out reality and replacing it with the digital one, we neglect our need for meaningful human interaction and emotional attachment.\n\nThirdly, technology can be a huge distraction from tasks we need to complete. We no longer have to leave our homes for entertainment, we can just access that online instead. Apps such as Facebook, Twitter, TikTok, Instagram, and Snapchat have the potential to keep us on our devices for hours, without us even realising it. In order to live a balanced and fulfilling life, we must be mindful of the amount of time we spend interacting with technology and taking it away from other activities.. We can fall into the trap of clicking on malicious links or downloading software from false sources, leaving our personal information exposed and vulnerable.\n\nIt is clear why I disagree with the increased use of technology in my life. \n\nFinally, misuse of technology could potentially lead to cybercrime or other forms of digital fraud. \nWith the increasing use of technology in our lives, many of us are becoming increasingly disconnected from our physical and emotional worlds. We can lose precious time that could be spent on more important tasks or even relaxation activities such as going for a walk, reading a book or listening to music. We now spend our days staring at screens, tapping away on devices and skimming through digital content, rather than engaging with the world around us. Too much time spent with screens and devices will lead us to miss out on important connections and experiences found in the real world, such as interactions with nature, conversations with our peers, and simply the joy of physical play outside. \n\nFirstly, I believe it's important to keep a balance between technological and natural elements of life. For example, a recent outing to the beach with family has highlighted the beauty of our natural environment and the importance of connecting with the physical world.\n\nSecondly, the heavy reliance on technology can be detrimental to our mental health. Instead of walking to the local store or post office, we can just order what we need online. Eventually this can lead to a decrease in physical fitness, leading to further health issues. \n\nFourthly, technology can make us lazy",

Students need to start eating healthy, and take care of themselves so they can stay energetic for the rest of the day. It's a good idea to change to a new, healthier school lunch menu because students will eat more healthy, students will not be obese, and they will be healthy instead getting sick every other day.\n\nMajority of the people who eat healthy on daily basis are always in good health. After six months she gained weight, and she was crying about it that she's never going to be fit again because she gained too much weight, but my mom told her that there's always a second chance, she was eating unhealthy, and wasn't taking care of herself so that's why she gained weight. It's a very good idea to tell students to fix their diet, and start to become responsible for what is good for their health and immune system. If you're fat then you become lazy, always not willing to work which is not good for health. No more junk food in the cafeteria anymore. Generic_Name listened to my mom and started eating healthy, she lost weight right after 8 months, and her stomach didn't used to hurt like it used to before all the time, that's why students need to eat healthy food from the cafeteria, and take care of their diet because they spend majority of their time in school. Students will not gain a lot of weight if they stick to their diet and eat healthy from the cafeteria.

Students wil not have stomachache or any other diseases. Changing to a healthier menu is a good idea because students will eat well, and start to like the healthy food instead of the junk food. My cousin Generic_Name used to eat unhealthy all the time, even from school cafeteria as well, and always used to cry about how her stomach used to hurt. Students will not eat junk food from the cafeteria anymore, and it would give students the opportunity to keep up with their body and be fit.\n\nStudents will be healthy instead of getting sick every other day. Eventually, students will start to like fruits and vegetables instead of chips and chocolates, and drink more water instead of soda, juice, and stay hydrated. Eating healthy is good because you learn how to maintain your health, and it helps you to eat well. Also, they will be more active. My mom always eat healthy, and takes care of her diet, she's 60 years old, and she doesn't have any diseases or anything. She told Generic_Name about her healthy diet and convinced her to immediately start eating healthy, stay hydrated, do not eat junk food on daily basis, and be diligence about working towards her goal to be fit. So, she always tells me to stay determined to eat healthy, stay hydrated, and that should be the case for everyone else as well. Students will the eat the food that is good for their health. Students will eat oat meal, milk, yogurt, and some fruits in the morning from the cafeteria. Their body will not contain any impurities, and they will not have any diseases. They will stay in shape because they will be eating healthy food from the cafeteria, and they will not have unhealthy condition of body or mind. So, students can have the opportunity to eat healthy and not face any dificulties related to their health. Students will maintain their health, and stay fit by following their diet. She's in good health. Cafeteria should only have healthy food. It would digest easily and students will not have stomachache or any other kind of pain in the morning after eating breakfast. So, people can minimize the amount of junk food they eat on daily basis. Eating healthy on daily basis, and going to the gym maximum twice a week can keep them in shape, and get rid of the illness.

Teachers just hand out papers and papers of homework without thinking about it. Being outside or in a new location gives students the chance to get to know their surroundings. The teachers also get brakes but they have their phones on them all day. One school activity that kids enjoy are field trips because it provides them a brake from school work and it gives them a opportunity to explore their surroundings. Teachers and students often get tired of being at one place everyday. My school has a outside siting area in the middle of the school but nobody gets to sit outside. meanwhile, students are trying to study for important stuff like tests,sols or exams.          . Many schools, like Generic_School, are extremely stuffy and dirty. I think there should be more field trips not just two a year. Being in a building that's stuffy all day makes many people annoyed. Students and teachers should not have to be in a place like prison. They also have packets of homework to complete and the packets are usually due the next day. Everyday students asks to go outside. I try to complete all the work i have but it is hard when all the teachers are saying,'my work is more important.' We are constantly reviewing, working or studying and sometimes it's just too much. Students have to complete lots of work that isnt needed. However, the teachers and staff always say no because the administrators wont allow it. This is why we want to go on field trips or go outside more often.\n\nSchools are not the most funnest place to be. Students are also constantly working and the only break they have is lunch and electives. however, being controlled and forced to stay in one place makes them feel like prisoners. This is why students love field trips and new outdoor places.\n\nIn conclusion, the most enjoyed activity in schools are field trips because it gives them a breather and it gives them the opportunity to explore.

Furthermore, if other courses like math and science are not seen as important due to the presence of these electives, then students may be less inclined to focus on pursuing a fulfilling, successful career path.

The work that is being given to them is not bad but the resources that makes is because of how it is made. Eventually, schools should just use technology and do all the work there. Like is it worth wasting all these resources rather than using technology.\n\nThere is advantages and disadvantages of extending school for two hours. It is important to save energy an keep the world safe. To make things easier for them would be to use front and back because there not using alot of paper. It is better for them not to waste time and get the help they need. If we were able to do that it would make everything else easier.\n\nOverall, schools should not be extending it for two more hours. Students never like to keep paper with them when teachers grade them after. The best way to save energy would be to turn off the light before you go out and not just leave it on because your just making your bills go up. Rather than wasting alot of materials for no good reasons. They would always do work on seprate pices of papers and give them to the students. So alot of paper is going to waste for no reason. Rather than just using more products to make the particular object. It is better to save energy rather than waste. Schools should just do everthing on computers and make things easier. Students would have more time to do work rather than doing it at home and struggling. If not we wouldnt be able to see things near us. Students would be able to access it easier and teachers would not have to worry about the students losing work or having problems. At times we take advantage way too much. Energy should be conserve more because alot of people do not use alot of these particular items half of the time. Us people should recycle more and save light source and actually help the world be a better place and keep it clean and simple. But, at the same time the teacher is giving them work which is bad in the way but good also . Alot of trees would be save and have alot of resources still. Alot of people tend to go out to places to run some errands and leave there lights on for no reason or just keep the light on for no particular reason. It would be better if the recycling bin was to be seen.                                   . So that it can be graded on and be thrown out by the students. Technology would help because trees would not be going to waste and harm the things around there surrounding just to make paper out of it. Therefor, were wasting alot of energy that we should not be wasting. I feel like people would use it and recycle more. It would help alot and keep you from wasting alot of money.\n\nSecond reason, would be us not recyling things that we drink or eat. We tend to just throw it in the trash instead of the recyling bin. People should just think about the goods thing and the bad things about it. Basically would not cause pollution in the air and hurt things around it like for example animals . Teachers should consider of teaching students with technology and doing work on there rather then using alot of paper. Like for eample, we use light everyday to see things around us so that we do not trip or bump into things. The advantage would be students being able to learn more and have more time spent with their peers and teachers. Even in schools they have recyling bins but us people do not pay attention to it because it is nowhere to be seen. Students would also be more entertain because all they like to do or be on is technology and it would help the teachers alot.\n\nOverall this point, teachers or not just them should consider of managing the time they use on things that use alot of energy. Trees would not have to be cut down alot and affecting their surroundings. Were wasting alot of light source that we hardly ever use at times.

They always worked hard to become the number one or wanting to be someone in general that people would look up to. they work nonstop to make sure my future is bright. That's because a lot of singers known to man never stopped singing or dancing.

After he made Tesla the best electronic car company to date he decided to keep moving forward with his plan to go all green. Well Thomas Jefferson once wrote \"Determine never to be idle..It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.\" Now when you think about it, is it beneficial if your always doing something or do you think inactivity also serves a purpose?\n\nIn my point of view I have to agree on what Thomas Jefferson has stated. I think I've said enough and stand by my opinion that if you are doing something you will accomplish what your wanting in the future like how this other people have just like Thomas Jefferson wrote. You can't accomplish something without working for it and I will be listing examples on why I believe in a strong way that if you keep doing something you'll be able to accomplish what you want.\n\nMy number one example is my parents, Of course its unthinkable that your parents want you to have the best future that you can get but have you ever asked on how they got to this point in life. My parents are heroes for me in a lot of ways but the most important one is how they never stay idle.

People are also influenced by those who have been into sports and who started in the struggle just like they've had, who later became the best. They influence people that you have to never give up in what you believe in or in what you hope to persue in life. Although through out their journey people may have put them down, they still try their best in being a good example for others and the generation after them. Showing good actions lead people to persuing you and your examples, which later leads them to the right path.\n\nWhen Albert speaks of an example influencing others many ideas come to mind, one of which was how people who grew up in broke homes and succeeded with their life have had a huge affect on the youth. They have gone through many obsticules to do what they love and see potential in. These people who are known for their success have gone through struggle and hard bottom rock moments. As we may know football, basketball, wrestlers, soccer, ect. These sports have not just helped people out with their physical apperiances but have also helped them out mentaly. Well known players have trained and worked hard everyday to be where they are today. These two however different but very similar examples both persuade others in; working hard and trying their best. They've taken risk and tried their best in their games or matches, they've given their all to be noticed by college coaches, or even scouts.\n\nHowever, both doing great in school and being a great athlete have been known for being a example in influencing others. For example, younger people look up to those who have struggled like they have and whom came from broke down homes and had succeeded through out their way. Leaders like these have worked their best to do what they want, which leads to having an amazing job with a great career.\n\nAlthough many people look up to those who came from rock bottom, they also look up to those who are well known for their athleticism. A man named Albert Schweitzer once said, \"Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing\". For example, for those who have started from not knowing the sport and who were told that they weren't good enough didn't just give up because they were told so, instead it pushed them into getting better. In this case setting an example by your own behavior is the best way to influence others. In conclusion, setting a good example by your own behavior is the best way to influence other people.. are sports that are well heard of through out different countries. People like this have gone to school and have worked hard in getting good grades to persue what they wanted to major in.

Needs are the most crucial things in life. Do we get astonished when people behaviors change over time? This makes us surprised and wonder because of their first impressions to us. Some examples of needs are shelter, clothes and foods. In the movie, a man named Mr. Last time, I was watching a Ghanaian movie with my family. People change all the time.\n\nPeer pressures and bad friends make people characters change to a different level.\n\nYou will meet a person who was respectful for the first time but later on, you will find the same person talking back and arguing with their teachers in a very bad way. A person may be good at the first time but changes later whiles a person may be bad at the first time but changes later because some factors like needs, depressions and poverty are affecting them. I disagree that, first impressions are almost impossible to change. Our teachers know the road to success so they have to be respected and treated in a very nice way.

And if we understands how the world is moving every seconds we all going to get peace!                . So the counselors helped her out and we became very close friends. We need all these to survive in life and we are going to lack something necessary, desirable or useful when we have no one to provide all those needs. No one gets married to his or her nemesis so bad pressures from our partners affect our characters. A girl who was very shy to talk in my class became the most disrespectful student in our class all because she joined some five bad girls in our school and after that, she decide to live the life she wants which was very bad. First impressions are possible to change all the time.\n\n\"Every coin has two faces\" so, we must deal with people in a very pleasant, patience and respectful way. So a person can act in a good way when you meet them for the first time because they just want to accomplish some goals. A behavior is a conduct of oneself in a particular way. His first impressions to them was to act and brag as a wealthy man who travels to foreign countries to hoax the women and get some money to cater for his family. She was so isolated and sad. You see how poverty makes a person behaves? So first impressions are possible to change because some factors affect humans all the time.\n\nSometimes relationship issues and depressions makes people behaviors change.\n\nMarriage is a union between two people in which no one can separate that. I realized she was very respectful, kind and good. First impressions are possible to change. How a person behaves the first time you meet them may change all the time. I decide to ask what was going on. Immediately I began to talk, she shouted as if I was a monster but later on I realized she was being bullied by some guys in our school. Depression makes people sad, causes difficulty in thinking and concentrating. Bright was very poor. Two years ago, I met a girl called Generic_Name. They can affect your future and perspectives. So how we see people for the first time doesn't mean that is how they are. A person's character is similar to how a pregnancy grows.

The older students are having bad grades in classes , their teacher will get a student who is really smart to be the older student twoder.. The older students have to assist the younger students, to do service hours or get credit on service and to do more and more service hours. What i think is it will be normal the effects like they will get use to it and they will mine they old busness plus to me they will say we gonna have to treat the younger students the same like everybody else . IT will help they can be friends, like they tell something about them self or they will fight either like some older students make fun of the younger kids that will be a problem to me this how it will go down the younger kids start fighting back and then it will be a war zone of fight older vs younger",
      "ai_text": "\n\nRecent research has shown that older students in school can have a positive influence on younger students. Furthermore, the older student's presence in helping with service hours can give younger students a sense of purpose. For example, by providing guidance and advice, the older student can help lead a younger student through difficult subject matter or give them encouragement and direction when it comes to their academic work. Additionally, there has been evidence that older students can act as mentors for younger students in areas where the older students have struggled themselves. All in all, having older students provide guidance and leadership to younger students in a school setting can have a number of positive effects.. With the sense of responsibility they get from helping, young students may become more invested in their school and academic work. This allows the younger students to relate to the situations better, trust the advice given and be more willing to try the tasks themselves",

The most obvious implication would be that students with lower grades would be allowed to participate in sports, which could ultimately result in an increase in student participation. On the other hand, allowing lower-performing students to participate could make them less inclined to put in the extra effort necessary to get an A or B grade, or to attend classes, as they may come to rely on sports as their primary source of motivation. Further, this could create an atmosphere in which the more successful students, who may have chosen to participate in sports as a reward for their hard work, would become discouraged and potentially less inclined to maintain their high grades. However, this could have both positive and negative side effects.

Also praising students help to built self-steam, but you only can praising when the student make your best effort.\n\nFor example; one student go to the bed at three in the morning and sleep only three hours making his project and checking all the project make sure is complete, but other student go to the bed at nine and sleep all night and don't worry about his project. They believe teachers need recognize all student's work not only some students.\n\nIn conclusion the teachers only need recognize student's work when the students really make a good work, best effort and this way the teachers can help to built self-esteem and motivate the student work hard in all the classes, projects, and homework.

When I think about praising student work, I think in: hard work, effort, patience, and a consistent student. Many times the students with high self-esteem are the students who go to the university, because they know are good in something; this is the reason because we have today doctors, lawyers, teachers, other professional people..

Success consists of going from failure without loss in enthusiasm. for example if a students want to graduate on time with there class mates they he has to get good grade pass the sol then he has to succeeded in school. That they don't want there education for college or a university if they don't succeeded . They have to love they job or do a better to succeeded in there job. Lets say that student that goes to school that they don't want to succeeded in there education. They don't want to pursuit anything because if they do then they are not succeeding in doing something else. I think that churchill's is wrong about that failure of the plays in the pursuit of success because not many people are failure of there success and many people are in inspired from what they are going and so many people are pursing a failure.\n\nFirstly, not many people are failure of there success. For instance people are are working or getting a job they have to be inspired of there job they have to succeeded in what they are going. Another example is if you are not succeeding then you can't do something just as outcome.\n\nSecondly, many people are inspired from what they are going to succeeding. If you succeeded in your job you might get a raise.\n\nThirdly, so many people are pursing to failure. They have to be enthusiasm meaning they have to be inspired.\n\nIin conclusion Winston churchhill's is a failure of the plays in the pursuit because not many people are failure that who want to success and many people are inspired from want there are going and finally so many people are pursing to failure.",

She accepted failure as part of the process, and used her courage and determination to make her dream come true. Consider Amelia Earhart, who wanted to make history and become the first female pilot to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean. Facing failure is not easy, but it encourages us to reach beyond our comfort zone and accomplish something extraordinary. \n\nWinston Churchill famously said that \"success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.\" Indeed, failure is an integral part of the pursuit of success, and understanding why is essential to maximizing your potential. \n\nThe second example of why not many people are a failure of their success is resilience. For instance, after Oprah Winfrey was fired from her television job at the age of 22, she used the experience to her advantage. \n\nThe first example of why not many people are a failure of their success is perseverance. She was determined to make something out of the failure and learn from it, and that\u2019s exactly what she did.

His ability to persevere through failure was the key to success in the end.

Every small act of kindness can, quite literally, help change the world. Why this phrase has sustained for centuries is because its truth is timeless.

One piece of advice that Aesop often repeated was to \"not waste any act of kindness\". It can show them that they are not alone and that somebody is there to support them. \n\nFor example, a simple gesture such as holding the door for someone or giving up your seat on the train may seem insignificant, but it could make a significant impact on the other person. \nThe Ancient Greek storyteller Aesop was famous for conveying profound lessons in his fables.

I was born in Generic_City 2006 and moved to Generic_City I grew in a town where snitching and getting into peoples life is a daily routine because people don't finish school bacause they are lazy and others who work to feed their family and never get an education and if you get to finish everything there arent many job options to enforce your career or to make money for yourself so you have to travel to the larger cities for work and you only get paid for day not by hours unlike the US.Everybody tells you to go to the US but everyone gives up because getting paper is super hard and stressful, the chance for you to get accepted are low so people just stay and get a job at a small store until they die and it is sad because they can't reach all the goals they wish they could achieve in such a developing country.\n\nSince I was 4 years old I wished to always go to the US because at that age I already knew I had no future back there and I used to watch tv a lot and the US looked like a promising place to live at and there we're more job opportunities and I could be what I wanted thats what everybody told you back in Generic_City, and some of it was true you get more chances to be what you want and not end up as a \"vago\" and not be a blockhead. My school was Generic_School which I used to get taken out of my class for a teacher to teach me english she told me I was the fastest english learning student she had in her entire career as a teacher which I was already starting to speak the language 6 months into the year with no background of me speaking the language in Generic_City.      . People used to say the language was their biggest obstacle even my mom said the same thing well I never thought I would come to the US of A I guess until my mom met my stepdad who brang us here but before comeing we spent a whole month and more on papers before coming to the US.It took a lot of money, work, and time which was the reason I did not want to come to the US because it frustrated me seeing my mom stressed out about some papers that we needed to come here where I now stand.\n\nOnce I came to Virginia my mom, and stepdad told me to work hard because the language would be my struggle as well as his when he came to the US around 20 years ago. But you know you have to go there because the education is not well supported by the government, and the president is corrupt and does not care about its people in your country so that is your option to be something in life. My first day of school I got in trouble in less that 1 hour and 27 minutes into the day, because some kids decided to bully me and thought I wouldn't say a word because I didn't know how to even say good morning in english well this all happened inside the hallway bathroom I beat them up because I totally forgot fighting was not allowed in the schools and they said \"He started it he was trying to hurt us we we're just trying to use the bathroom and he came out of nowhere\" and I got in trouble I wanted to say something but I only knew one word in english which was \"hi\". Imagine you are going to a diffferent country, and you do not know anything about that country or how it works and you have only heard people talk about it or may have seen it in movies. I was in fourth grade by the time I could comprehend almost what everyone was telling me and all the kids became my friends even the ones who had bullied me a year ago.

The best way to ensure a successful first impression in any situation is to be prepared, engage actively with the other party, and come off as confident and genuinely interested in the situation.. This is particularly true of situations such as job interviews, college admissions, and meeting people in social settings. Unfortunately, this means it can be difficult to change a first impression once it has been established. It can set the tone for how people perceive you, even influencing how you are treated later on. For example, if you come off as shy or uninterested during an interview, the hiring manager may decide that the person they're interviewing is not the right fit for the job. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to recover from a bad one.

This also makes the student more relived that he or she can listen to music.         . Also coming to school late makes it very hard to understand what was taught in the classroom making a student very stressed over it because a student grade might go down because he or she failed the test cause they came late to school so that student might not have understood what was taught.\n\nFinally students could have more time to study and work on their assignments sometimes teachers may go through the assignment very quickly making it hard for a student to understand the what he or she or supposed to do. Working at home could be very beneficial because It could be very difficult for another student to learn at school because they might be that one student who is making it hard for a student trying to focus or a student might be stressed because they might not have a ride to and back from school and worried that they might not enough time to finish their assignment and get it turned in on time. Finally students could have more time to work and study making it easy for students to revise in a quite place at home.\n\nStudents could limit distractions in many ways at home one way is that they can put on headphones to relax and work hard and listen to some music. Some teachers hate when students have their phone out or when they are listening to music so begin at home may cause the student to focus more by listening to music because every student has a different way of studying and one student might be more focus if he or she loves listening to music when working or studying. Students can benefit from listening to music because for me when I listen to music while I am working I feel great and energetic making it easy for me to knockout my work at a fast rate.\n\nSome students could live far away from the school and may not have a reliable ride to take them to school everyday. Working at home may not stress a student because they would have enough time to complete an assignment. Students who are always trying to bust a joke or make a noise causes problems for a student who is trying to work to get her grade up this makes it very hard for a student to focus on what their are supposed to do. This is why working on assignments at home would benefit a student. When learning at school with other students who cause distractions it is always hard to focus would you be able to focus? Even though going to school makes you socialize with friends and they feed you it sometimes is hard for a student to show up to school or even learn.\n\nFor me I would rather work on my assignments and others things my teacher would like me to do at home reason why is that some students would not be able to focus especially when a student is causing lots of noise making it hard for you to focus on your assignment. This makes a student stress a lot thats why working at home you would not be worried about who would be taking to and back from school. Some students can't catch the bus because the bus is too far away from their house this makes going to school very difficult because without a reliable ride to school everyday you may be coming to school very late making it hard for you to study or work on assignments because you are worried about how you will get home because you do not have a reliable ride to school to home. Sometimes students worry about things like this especially when a student grade is flunking and they need to get it up to graduate or move on to the next grade level.\n\nAlthough going to school could very exciting for a student or very happy to see friends your happiest place is home and if you could a student could work from home that would change the way a student studies and complete assignment because they have time on their hands and also the are relaxed they would not have to sit in a class for over 55 minutes.

And parents should just be more protective so they don't end up going home late. You will be more safe home with a guardian or sibling then outside in the dark and not knowing who is outside. Another example a teenager can be at there friends house and if they leave late or outside with there friend, anybody can be outside and would want to hurt them or there friend because it's dark out, but if you have the 10 pm curfew you can leave without worrying about being in trouble.

If you do not have enough sleep, but can have the 10 pm curfew to help you to get some rest and will also help you concentrate in school. My argument about the 10pm curfew for teenagers statement; is they should have a curfew for teenagers because it can get them out of trouble, and make it home safe and they can get rest for school.\n\nExample of staying out of trouble is you can get mistaken at night; and get hurt just by not going home at the right time. And another reason is they can get good sleep for teenagers is very helpful for them so they can have a lot of energy and concentrate in class better and get good grades.. because if you are scared to go home late or can't get some rest just stay home.

He goes to sleep late, had bad grades and he wake up late for school. However, I had seen some students who used their cellphone during classes. Amazon has a strong impact of sales in the world, Their sales are more high than any other stores. I believe that the life is so short to waste.\n\nIn the final analyses technology will keep going to destroy our cultures.

My point of view is that what she told me was true because I came to United Stated of America since 2016; I was not be able to understand or speak to others. Their sales had exceed on online store than in the located stores. Also it had destroyed our culture. Technology helps us to communicate with our families and friends.

Additionally people who work in this stores are going to have a layoff due to this matter.\n\nAnother reason that technology has negative effects on people's lives is that some places are empty namely: Parks, lakes, and malls. everything in this world is going to be different. Students are distracted with their cell phone at schools. It limited the growth of children because, they do not want to go outside to play with their friends.

With the ease of access to information, many people no longer take the time to carefully analyze and reflect on issues.\n\nFurthermore, technology has had a detrimental effect on curiosity. While technology has a vast array of benefits, it has the potential to lead to feelings of isolation, depression, and anxiety when misused. On the one hand, technology has made it easier than ever to connect with people from around the world, but this has also caused a reliance on screens and keyboards as opposed to face-to-face interaction.

By keeping the school day the same but battle this pacing battle by lengthening the entire school year, schools are providing more time for students to learn and discover.\n\nIn conclusion, there are serious drawbacks to extending the school day. Such activities may include sports, music lessons, and volunteer work \u2013 activities that involve the body and the mind, and that are necessary to a rounded curriculum. A longer day means more hours of learning and responsibility. These drawbacks include possible disconnection of fathers with their children, increased strain on students, lost time for other activities important for development, and the introduction of alternative ideas to helping students succeed.",

I think making a homework club is wonderful for students a homework club can help students improve their grades,have more free time,\n\nless tired from school, and grateful to turn to that and get help from teachers and students at the same time.\n\nFirst, of all, establishing a homework club is creative because it helps students improve their grades. Students have the ability to spend time with their family and friends, and go places. They also, get to study more and don't have to worry about failing the test. Lets say a student is having difficulties on a question on their homework. Everyday Students these day try and try the best they can but they lose hope because they feel like they can't do anything. A student can stay after school and get help with the questions they have trouble with or needs help with.\n\nAlso, students have more free time after school. Students get more work done when teachers and other students are helping them. Students should have it easy because theses days students go through so much in life. if i joined a club like that i'd be happy because i wouln't be the only one who struggles on work and we could help each other out on work we don't understand.\n\nFurthermore, A homework club helps students less tired. A homework club sounds like a club i would join because after i come home i'd relax or go out or hangout with some friends. They get to sleep more and wake up the very next day and get ready for school. They don't need to worry their grades being bad because they had help from teachers and students",

This interactive environment can lead to deeper understanding of material, as well as a broader network of knowledge, since members can draw on each other\u2019s unique strengths and experiences. Being in such an environment can also boost confidence and self-esteem, since it provides a platform for individuals to share their opinions and solutions while encouraging others. Assignments that involve complex problem-solving, research, and writing can be difficult for many students, and a homework club offers the opportunity to collaborate in a constructive and supportive environment. \nIntroducing a homework club can be beneficial to students for a variety of reasons, from developing important skills to forging a sense of community. Working on assignments as part of a team can also help students develop their social and communication skills, as well as their ability to work as part of a cohesive group. Therefore, creating a homework club can be an important learning resource for students, enabling them to work together fruitfully for mutual growth and development.",

Doing own projects workers show more production In the factory and result good Therefore this help to get alot resources by workers.\n\nCompetiton is a ways to decrease the teamwork. When i do my own work i feel excite cause, i could receive an award for be a good producer. The person that different quality could be someone that can help. Work in gruop is affect by bet. For example in the govermen there are many people with a big level to compite with other this, that means it i s has a great achievement in the government,so i agree with Emerson statement cause the competition provide good benifit for us and too the progress of the government,factory,countries,therefore being a part with competiton meke us to improve our best. But to be award we have to hsave capacity in the jobs Many person due the same thing like me cause doing my the own work provide a big result. So working by my self make an emotion to work hard and to increase the amoung. Examples could be when a person start to work in his job and start to recieve more money because the person is doing a great work ,this make that others poerson get mad so in the factory start the competition cause everyone want to recieve more money and they thick is unfair be reciving the same amoung of money so they start to argued why the manager give more money to the new guy but the thing is that he has a good specialization in the job. fighting by my self i could be a big man in the socierity. Because sometimes nobody is with us to provide help. Because this help to provide, work hard, competition, and bocome the best .Individuality is a good factor to trust in my self to be the best because help us to look for option that help our lifes\n\n.Working by my self make me work hard. I agree with Emerson statement because with the individuality we can reach all our goals.\n\nIt is to important for me to recognize that i have to get my goals with effort. The individuaity help alot in the world to be a succesful place. To do a good competition the work have to be alone to and with big group people. Currently in the world we have many competition one example can be soccer,almost the majority look in the tv .Soccer is a game where a team have 24 for player. Because, this kind of person make the differences in the world trying to win in a place where the competition and the demand are in high level ,so they try to have imfluences in the in their jobs. everybody want to be award for their job so everrybody wish a reward. individual competition is a big example of overcome. concecuently Many time the work competition provide a good production in the factory so, everyone want to get their goals like a good amount of products also,big accomplishment occur with the worker is trying to find a new way to get more product than other. In many companies the owners look for a way that workers produces a lot and they offer money or free time to the person that make more products .as result, being in a factory with many labors working seperated make a big impact where everyone want to procud the most materials. They have to compite who is the leader in the team. Being a different person than others. So the best thing that could can happens in our life is be a place where frecuently we are demand to do different things. when a person work by his own company he try to do a great work fixing everything it is the such as work alone, if you work alone yo going to do a perfect job to impresione others labors .For example, when i work without partner, i try to do a great gob to be one on the best workers. Because,if we wish to be different than the rest of persons and realize our goals. Not matters what tell about us such as critique,bullying ,etc. For example, when a worker finished his assignment could receive free time,this make feel angry other workers so , they are going to try to look for others forms to produce more than the winner because, they want to receive the same reward for the production . The only thing that is important for us who we are. Although with many problem we have to be patience and support all bad things. Every one in this life want to have something to be recognize in this world althogh,to be a succefull person we have to work hard. So like in the real life the leader is the person that work hard,help the other players .Otherwise, could be a leader in a company, to be the leader of a company ,the leader had to compite with other person that wanted to become a big leader ..Therefore to be a person succesfull have to take individual decision .\n\nBeing in a world where have to take decision and concern about goals is the best thing that we can have to show our capacity. Consequently to do a individual work make a good results. competition is a good way for individuality work to provide a emotional affect. Living in a place with frequentely hihgest demand to provide my best, is one the must important achievement. thought must be working by our selves. Therefore,challenge could be a a good idea for separated jobs .\n\nLooking for an accomplishment to become the best",
      "ai_text": "Competition can also establish personal accountability, meaning that employees are more likely to take ownership in their work and be driven to produce better results. \nIndividual competition in the workplace can provide beneficial advantages to employees looking for a competitive edge. Additionally, individual competition can foster creativity and innovation, as challenges can act as an incentive to solve problems quickly and find new, more efficient solutions. For those who are successful in achieving these goals, the rewards of the competition are high as they can gain recognition and experience productive growth in their career.

Students can't be focused to do mainly anything they have to find what they like for they can do it. If the company helps the students then the students are going to want to take classes about it. Should students have partnerships with companies that interest the type of employment they want? Students think it's a great idea to go to different businesses because it will be helpful to them in the future. They learn how to control the mechanical stuff over at the company.

In order too always do something you should just look for something you like to do,to keep yourself busy like: playing soccer, working out ,rather not doing anything ,and just being on your phone on social media.\n\nIn my opinion being be responsible and accomplishing is a whole relief ,and taking your time getting stuff done can also help to focus.\n\nFor us kids our responsibility is to get good grades in school, and graduate,be successful in life to become better than what our parents were,or be a better person by being active and helping a church out .People sometimes need emotional support because everybody is different, everybody handles their attitude,or situations differently,and they might be going through something and it will affect their life. We the people shouldn't be idle at all ,it would be boring ,not doing anything like just relax at home,and get fat on the couch,being lazy from time, to time isn't as bad. Also you want to have a break,so you won't stress out as much. Most people are determine to be inactivity and will get upset or,have a panic attack,health issues,It can affect your life to be honest ,and it sucks! that's how life is,it gets harder,and harder and you need to motivate yourself, makes your mind stronger. Taking a position of where I stand in school is me failing tests because,I don't study and I know,I should study but when I try too, I forget ,and forget the next day ,and I hate that, I know ,I can pass my tests ,and get better grades, if I studied this is one of my accomplishment I need to work on.\n\nThomas Jefferson wrote that because, he wants to motivate people to accomplish more by doing things and finding a job, and work hard,by being successful. People got to be always doing something ,and be well organized,it will also be wonderful too see people not being idle too always be doing something,so they would feel good about themselves and be like \"Yes! I did it!\"and that way they won't have to deal with it anymore ,and move on with their day,just like anybody should.                                                                                                                                                 . People who don't motivate themselves they got to at least try to get things done, and it never gets any easier....you just got to do it like this essay;I'm writing.\n\nAn inactivity does serve a purpose based on people who don't accomplish much by being lazy and not realizing how the situation can get worse instead of getting it done on time. Thomas Jefferson also did some things,He wrote the Deceleration Of Independence,he is one of the Founding Fathers and accomplished being our President.\n\nThere are lots of people in this world with different point of views of how they accomplish of always doing something,people try to plan out ideas to see what will work out for them, and help them think harder based on how they handle what works for them because,their is plenty of strategies in the world people can use to do something,what makes them feel more comfortable .It is very important for people to accomplish things that they need to do to get it off their hands and help each other out, if they need help ,and not stress about it but,most things you can't depend on someone being their,you got to do it on your own ,and if your stressing about it, you just got to relax your mind ,take yoga if you have too! but than again everybody is different and at least you need to try because,if you dont do that than where do you think your set of accomplishments is gonna go?. Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something,or does inactivity also serve a purpose?\n\nThe way you determine to do things is pushing yourself to do it, nobody gonna be there to tell you, when you gotta get your stuff done",

Productive activities, such as research, problem-solving, reading, and project-building, can help us to pursue our ambitions and are important for personal growth. He wrote in a letter to William C. In his view, moments of pause could lead to reflection, contemplation, and self-examination\u2013all of which are critical mental exercises that can lead to increased productivity, once motivation has been restored. Idle activities, such as watching TV, scrolling through social media, or playing video games, can\u200b be enjoyable, but can also reduce our motivation and prevent us from reaching our goals. To achieve our goals, we must utilize strategies such as breaking them up into manageable parts, setting a timeline for completion, and utilizing motivational techniques. \n\nAt the same time, Jefferson believed that inactivity could have an important role to play in how we use our time.

      "human_text": "Start now, and don't let stuff handed to you. Trust me you will not regret it, if you just start making good habits for yourself. Ah, yes nobody likes a person that's just \"normal\". You would want to meet different people, and find new things, and also most importantly learn new stuff by different people. You would want people with different personalities, not the same ones, as that would be boring. For example: doing your homework, and stop procrastinating on the stuff you need to do, or want to do, doing tasks when you don't feel like it. You are more active, than just sitting down. No one can stop you, because your mindset is on a whole new other level. Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose? I believe that if we do more, then we get more things done. You know why? because you're a action taker, and not just a dreamer, who just expects stuff without the hard work. Nobody wants to hang out, or deal with someone that is just negative all day, or a loser. You are taking your chances, and not blowing it. For example:There is a saying that If someone is hating on you, then you're doing something great, if they're not hating on you, then you're not doing anything really.\n\nMy second reason is that you're a type of person willing to do anything to achieve your goals. People can't ketch up to you, and people will be jealous of your success. You will have haters. Don't wish, and wait. You will let nothing in your way. You are ready to grab life by it's neck, and just yank it, cause it's yours. You are taking advantage of life, than just wasting it. You also get more noticed, and people will like to be around you, because you're more active, and you're more unique than most people.. You will be great, and you'll thank yourself in the future.\n\nMy third reason, and final reason is you get more noticed, and people will like to be around you, because you're more active, and you're more unique, than most people. You gotta take over your life now. For example: You wouldn't want to meet the same people every time now would you? of course not. They would like a person that is quite different, and not the same as everybody else you know. They would want to hang with someone that is quite active, respectful, and successful.\n\nMy conclusion: Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose? I believe that if we do more, then we get more things done. I say that because if you just do what you're gonna say, rather than talking about it, you can get very far in life, and you will be successful. I find that quite lame, and boring. Hate on you, but don't let that slow you down! keep doing, and achieving and great things will come down to your way. I say that because if you just do what you're going to say, rather than talking about it, you can get very far in life, and you will be successful. You also get more noticed, and people will like to be around you, because you're more active, and you're more unique, than most people.\n\nMy first reason is that if you just put that action into movement, then you're powerful already. You know why? because you're a action taker, and not just a dreamer, who just expects stuff without the hard work. You gotta work for it, and just love the process",

Taking actions in pursuit of a goal can open you up to new relationships and collaborations. With each new action you take, you\u2019ll find yourself closer to your goal.

For example, if you\u2019re starting a business, you might take action by researching potential markets, writing a business plan, and creating a website.\n\nLastly, taking action can help you make meaningful connections. For example, if you\u2019re trying to launch a project, you can take action by joining relevant Facebook groups, attending local meetups, and actively engaging with potential collaborators.\n\nBy taking action as opposed to just dreaming, you can make your goals more achievable, gain momentum, and build meaningful connections - three clear reasons to take action rather than remain inactive.",

Some wants to be doctor,some wants to be an engineer,pilot,photographer,dancer,etc. Employment is not the biggest thing,but the interest is the biggest things. In this 21st century,all the parents wants their children to be a doctor or an engineer or in the other biggest post but not all the children have same interest as their parents have. It helps me to understand about the characteristic of the different works, and also helps me to recognize my interest for my career. If we have interest in something, we defiantly work hard to get that goal. If I understand my journey, then I expect that I will success to get my destination. So, if the school or any companies allow students to explore or visit about the works, they better understand the value of their interests and never join in any other works that they don't want to be. For example: If you left your dog in a street that he never walked,\n\nthen how can you expect that he accomplished his destination? Same happened to the students life, if someone who is well-experienced didn't tell them about the journey of life or how to choose their interest,how can we except that they will become a successful person.\n\nLastly, I want to say that if you select me to visit and learn about the work ,then I get opportunity to learn about my interest which helps me to get a better future. So, I really don't want that same things happened to me.\n\nTime is very important for everyone. That's why, I don't want to be confuse in my life.

Now a days, school have partnerships with companies to help students to choose their interests employment. I want to be clear about my future.\n\nAll the people in this world are different, they have different aim in their life. Schools makes you capable to choose your own way. Employment is the thing that helps you to do best in your life and also helps us to understand who we are and how important we are. For example: I had a one friend whose name is Generic_Name, she choose to be a doctor in first, but then she realize that she never had any interest in doctor. And also, if you select me I will aware other people about the interest or works and also help them to choose their interest. Although they have different aim or interest, they join in the work that their parents wants because they don't understand the value of their interest. Career is directly related to the employment. So,why students waste their time to choose the way that they don't want to go. So, I humbly request you that please select me to visit and learn about the work that I have interest to do.\n\nGeneric_Name,             . The main reason to go school is to make our career. After that, she left her job and become a photographer because photographic is her real interest not to be a doctor. I have an example of my own sister: In first, she joined in the medical line because my parents wants her to be a doctor and after she read some of the courses of the medicine,she realize that her interest is not to become a doctor and then she left her courses and start another courses.

On this one i have tried my really best so you could understand me what am talking about.\n\nSo please please please i beg you am just asking for just once; but if i don't pass thank you for taking your time on reading it; plus English is my second language and i dont understand it that much, and i can't read it that well either. But like i always say \"Love yourself and how you look no matter what people say, the only one who could change you is yourself.\"\n\nSecond, I don't think you can make yourself taller because there is no way that you can become taller then you already are , and don't you think that the really short people will be taller by now then shorter.\n\nI think that they would not like to be short because in this world there is really mean people that will laugh about others, or how they look, and how short they are. Even if you try you all you can do is to try to have a nice body, but about you height i don't think you could get taller then you already are. Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, \"Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.\" Will if you try will you be able to grow more? Does it matter what you eat? What can you do about you height? I disagree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson because i dont think that you can make yourself taller. I don't think that you can do anything about your height because it depends on your family too. This world is not that perfect because if it was everything or everyone will be how they world want to be in this world. So that is why I think that there is no way to make yourself taller.\n\nDon't you think that short people will be short, and be laugh at no they would not like that son that is why i disagree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson.\n\nIn the other hand, it does matter to eat healthy so you can be in shape and you will be in this life longer. Normally you can do anything about your height because trust me if you could i've been taller by now. If you really skinny you can eat a little bet more, but if you like how your are now you dont have to change anything. I don't like to be short because sometimes i get judged by my height, or how i look, and how chubby i am and i would like to have everything perfect like all those ladies and girls in the magazines or in the TV shows, and i would like to be 6 .3 ft tall then 5.3 ft. So that is why i disagree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson as you can see i give reasons and examples.\n\nThis goes to the person that ready's my story please give me a changes to pass just one i have never pass an SOL before and i will be really happy if you could pass me just once in my life. So yeah they is no way to change how you look , but by fixing yourself like: Appalachians, surge, and other things you understand what i mean right.\n\nSo that means that i still disagree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson because there is no way that people can make them self taller because even short people or person will be the size or shape they will like to be. He say if you try will it even work? I still think if you try it wont work because the height we have now is because our father in heaven made how we are now.\n\nFirst, it doesn't matter if you try or not your height and how you look it comes from your parents genes, and it can also come from another family member",

But when you have attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing you will not have a conversation between others students to get more knowledge.\n\nIn my opinion, I prefer schools attend classes because when you focus with the teacher you will understand more about the term.                                             .

Some schools offer distance learning as a option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing.\n\nMy position on this issue, I think students would not benifits from being able to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing, because schools programmes its helping you to get more informations, learning more things to get high level.\n\nFor example when you attend classes in the schools it will be conversations between the teachers and students about the term than you will benifits more informations and working between students like a groups its reason to get more knowledge.\n\nattend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing you will not have attention like in schools classrooms because the teachers they helping you to understand and explaine more.\n\nWhen you have a research at schools attend classrooms you can use technology and books and you can work like groups it will be more easy to do your research.

For instance, distance learning may lack the social aspect of traditional school. In addition, it can be more difficult to stay motivated with distance learning, as students don't have structured environments or built-in support systems. It all depends on the student's individual needs and preferences.",

      "human_text": "The United States and our world today would not be the same without time spent idle,. Contrastingly, if one is always working, then one has a much greater risk of crashing. However, there is merit in a world that does not work without break and resolves to be idle at times. In schools, teachers emphasize the necessity of brainstorming before writing, and this concept is emphasized so much because inspiration is what leads to the development of mankind. The potential of the human brain would reduce, as the human brain would never have the time to step back and reflect on its past experiences and how it wants to reflect lessons learned from those experiences in the future. This concept ties in with the concept of unhealthy comparison, which further proves why mental health is one of the largest reasons as to why the world cannot constantly work. Mental health is an essential reason as to why the world today does not and cannot constantly work as Jefferson wants it to. A world that is always working may also be a world that is burning out, diminishing the value of building connections and reflecting. A world that is idle when it recognizes its need to be has more value than a world that is always working, as it allows time for cognitive development and reflection, mental health, and inspiration.\n\nIn the body, the brain represents an entity that is constantly developing, creating new ideas, and planning for the future. Every idea would be thought of on the spot, and the potential ramifications and consequences of each idea would not be carefully taken into consideration. Furthermore, if one's life is spent constantly working, one's brain is exposed to extreme competition and high standards. In addition, the human brain requires breaks to keep working, just as the human body needs sleep to continue on the next day in a healthy state. Role models also result from the need for the world to take a break, as it allows for humans to gather inspiration from others and plan how they want to lead their lives. Without time spent being idle, the inventions, buildings, ideas, movies, and other parts of the world today would have never come to fruition. Several stories in the world detail the downfall of the most intelligent people, simply because the never took a break for themselves. In colleges, the requirements for acceptance do not only include academic excellence - they also include extracurriculars and attention to when the brain needs a break. If students did not take time off to develop, their potential for achievement in life would reduce. If one's brain is constantly in a working state, it will never spend time appreciating the beauty of the world around it and taking in inspiration for future plans. Constant work leads to stunted development, deteriorated mental health, and no sources for inspiration. For example, if Thomas Jefferson had not taken time off to create new ideas and plan for his country before writing the Declaration of Independence, the United States would be very different from the way it is today. Time spent being idle carries the potential to be a valuable learning experience to the human life, as well. These two concepts are unhealthy for the human brain, as one may believe that they actually are not working hard enough and need to work themselves even harder, when reality shows that they already work themselves unhealthily. Time spent idle does not equal time spent wasted; time spent idle is time spent reflecting, planning, and developing. A prime example of this concept is the work of artists. Without inspiration, the world would not be where it is today.\n\nCognitive development and reflection, mental health, and inspiration represent three of the most essential reasons as to why the philosophy of Thomas Jefferson cannot apply to how the world works today. If an artist such as Vincent Van Gogh or Claude Monet was constantly working, said artist would never spend time collecting inspiration, and the work of said artist would be mediocre instead of beautiful and inspiring. Those who always work also always compare themselves to others who are working, and often times do not take into account that what they are doing is very unhealthy. Therefore, a world spent constantly working does not always represent a world of accomplishment.\n\nSome argue that if one is not always working, then one cannot accomplish as much as one can, as a minute spent idle could lead to a day spent idle, and so on. All of these concepts combined greatly heighten the chance in the deterioration of mental health. Many studies show that top students in classes, those who never stop working towards their goals, can have a greater risk of developing depression, anxiety, or addiction to drugs. If a human was always working, there would be no time to create new ideas or plan. A world spent working constantly is a world exposed to bad mental health.\n\nFinally, if the world is spent constantly working, then there is no time for inspiration of any sort. Thomas Jefferson, writer of the Declaration of Independence and founding father of the United States, once said, \"Determine never to be idle...it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.\" In Jefferson's eyes, a world spent in constant work and motion represents a more productive and accomplished world. Thus, if the world was constantly working, there would be no inspiration. Inspiration flows from person to person, and if everyone was working constantly, no one would serve as a source of inspiration for others around them. A person always working does not represent a person living life to the fullest. This is because their brains cannot comprehend the constant work, and moves to other unhealthy tactics of releasing emotions. Also, brainstorming represents one of the most important parts of formulating any plan for any person in any situation, and constant work does not allow time for that brainstorming and inspiration to occur",
      "ai_text": "He states that \"incessant execution of labor is the only proof of our existence, and, as long as we are executing, we cease to be mere shadows, and become real and living things.\u201d \n\nJefferson's perspective can be applied to the world today by valuing effort and dedication. The same principle can be applied to any challenge; those who strive to excel and devote themselves to their tasks will be rewarded with greater satisfaction and personal growth.\n\nIn conclusion, Jefferson's views on constant work and motion can be applicable to the world today. While hard work and dedication may not always have an immediate reward, in the long run they enable us to lead more fulfilling lives and excel in whatever challenge we face.. He believes that it is excellence, rather than idleness or comfort that create true happiness. For example, when studying for a degree or preparing for a job interview, the amount of effort and dedication a person puts into their task will be reflected in the results. \nIn his essay 'On Motion and Merit', Thomas Jefferson argues that we should embrace labor and constant movement in order to live our most fulfilling lives. In the modern era, hard work is often a key factor in finding success and achieving individual goals",

Having different perspective also gives you different opinion. I believe that the community can become better when given advice. I believe that having different opinions is something you should always consider because you most likely will hear the same thing and you might like what they say but you might hear something different and you might like it even more. I think that it's amazing how much advice form who know how long ago has come so far. Advice that is given to you now will help you your whole life. Let's say you fail a test and you have a really bad adtuided and you asked many people what could you do to help and what they say can make you feel better which causes you to have a better a adtuided.

Following parents or close family member to the career they choice. Then they don't have to follow their parent career, and they can choice their own career, or any close family members, or anyone they look up to, and would like to be as close as possible as them when their older. It's pretty simple that you don't have to worry about what your career is going to be. It can be a lot easier if you know what you want to be, you can already plan the courses you would like to take. When someone does say that you would have a answer and you should say it proudly. Reasons I agree are, they may want to follow their parents choice in career, can use school courses to excel in career choice, and why it's a good idea to start a young age.\n\nThey can follow their parents choice in career. Schools are all different so not all of them will have the same courses. Don't let anyone distract you on what you want to do.\n\nConclusion on why it's a good ideal for students' to have a career choice in their younger age. The more experience you get from this courses will give you in vantage to the other student that choice your career later in their high school years.\n\nFinally the last reason, why it's a good idea to start early. If you want to be a engineer you have to take your four main classes Math,Science,History,English. Example if you want to be a chef and some sort of cook, you can take a cooking courses for the year. You can always just follow your own career and can start a generation for your family to follow your example.\n\nIf the parent choice didn't work they can choose what classes they can take to help them reach the career the student wants. Is it a good idea for a young students to commit to a career in high school? It's a great idea so students can work on there career, and not need to focus on what they don't need in high school, to work towards their career. When asked that question on what your going to be, you'll be ready answer it.. You shouldn't say that it's just rude to say. That can be a easy choice for many people, because the student can ask for advice from their parents. There are so many choices in career's you can pick from. You would just focus on what you need to do. These classes will help you in the long run through high school years. They can ask their parents what courses' they took as a young student as they once were. When people ask you \"what are you going to do when your done with school?\" you would say \"it's none of your business will see in the years to come!\". The reader may be asking \"what if their parents' didn't go to high school?\" that can be true and what if the career the parents' have isn't for the student to follow. If their career choice isn't for you, make a career you can follow and want to follow",

      "human_text": "However, the person need to be interest on the topic you're talking about or just be goofy. That hurt me so much that months past by an you even feel better without that friend because since the begging she was giving me fake impressions and I didnt catch on.\n\nIn conclusion, Sometimes you need to calm down before to start speaking to a person. For Example: If a Hispanic kid decide to ask a person for the class room number and that person start to laugh in his face the Hispanic kid gonna feel oppress and feel bad. First Impressions will never change cause once you speak whatever come out your mouth is gonna stick to that person forever. They bring a side of me that when they said bad stuff they think that I am going to stay quiet. Be nice and never let negative thoughts on your mind that are going to make you look bad. I been nice, but sometimes I gotta get mad with people cause they don't even know you and start calling you names but is not worth it to think about that cause that said a lot about their first impressions. If you wanna make new friends or have the respect that you want you only got to show them your nice impression. The person wants attention all the time but then start talking mess up things about you. For Example: My Ex BFF a year before we stop talking we meet and is was fun, but until I left to VA she decide to not care for me,text me, or call me. Fake Impression led you to think that the other person is talking behind your back. Why I disagree that first impression are almost likely to never change overtime? Well,In this world many people have experience bad,nice,and fake first impressions. I have experience people making fake impressions when they said Hi they look at you a certain way that you know is wrong. If your in pain or suffering don't take out your anger on others cause for a first impression you going to be looking like a bad guy. People sometimes come up to you and smile and said hi or was sup because they know you're alone. I just give them the same energy back because nobody deserved to be treated on a bad way when you're trying to just said Hi or want a new friends. People don't realize that by first impressions you could win the whole world, but no people like to be hard and act childish.\n\nThree,Fake Impressions make the person to take advantage of your opportunities and your personality. She smile back to him and then she went to bed.\n\nTwo, I have experience bad impressions about people being rude for no reason. You know that you when accomplish somebody smile or laugh that's everything to them is important that is their first reaction and by First Impression you can win the world by been nice all the time and make new friends or win the respect that you deserve or them.. Why because people have a bad feeling about you, you are not aware of what is happening in their heads, and maybe they just wanna take advantages of your personality or who you are.\n\nOne, First Impressions that I deal with everyday is give nice impressions with my friends. For Example: In the movie Everything,Everything the girl couldn't go outside because she could get sick,but the new neighbor his name is Generic_Name and he decided to smile and said hi through the window. Let people talk to you first and then think about their first impression. The person pretends to like you, but in particular the person don't care about your feelings or the friendship",
      "ai_text": "An example of a negative first impression could be when two people are meeting for the first time and one seems uninterested in what the other is saying, coming off as disinterested or rude. People often make assumptions based on first impressions, whether it's a job applicant's clothing or the body language of a person they're meeting for the first time. \nFirst impressions can have an immense effect on the success of relationships, both personal and professional. Positive first impressions can lead to further conversations that help foster strong relationships and lay the groundwork for successful interactions in the future. On the other hand, negative first impressions can lead to misunderstandings that can damage relationships before they even have the chance to begin. An example of a positive first impression is when two co-workers initially meet and find common ground by sharing an interest in a certain hobby or activity. While first impressions may not always be accurate, they can have a lasting impact and it is important to be mindful of how we present ourselves to others in order to create a positive impression.",

Students should not be alowd to graduate with the three year program because the student my have a job, focus on there academics, be involved in a extra curricular activities after scholl. A student may have to go home and work on big projects or homework so there ability to stay after school is going to be limited due to the fact that they have homework to do and other assignment. Students my also need to save up for a higher education if they plane on attending a 4 year university or even attending a community college. One other major reason is that the student with be involved in extra curricular activity such ass sports some sports can be year around sports so even is not there season they still have to condition and train for the upcoming season so they are most likely going to have to stay after school hours to do those things. another reason is that they might be involved in clubs so they also have to stay after school and also have to do some type of volunteering in the community so thats going to take away time so they may not be away available to attend to all the required classes to be able to graduate using the 3 year program. some students are not going to be available after school because they may have to stay after school to retake important quizzes or test that are going to affect a big part of there grade. students also need some time of work expires so they need that job so they are able to put on there resume that they have some form of work expires so if they decide that right after high school they want to just jump in into the work force they have some type of work expires.     . Another reason why students should not be allowed to do the 3 year program is because its going to be stressful trying to put a 4 year education in 3 years.

PROPER_NAME goes to school, but he lives alone. Therefore the schedule of five-day school week should not be changed.\n\nAnother reason why my school should keep its schedule of five-day school week is that, the standard week of five days gives the opportunity to do activities after school, such as: work, homework, sports or spend more time with our families. They think that weekends aren't enough and they really need and extra day off to cover their needs. If our school changes the schedule of five-day school week that each day is formed for eight hours, instead having a four-day school week of ten hours per day, but having an extra day off. In this case students might feel tired of being ten hours in school, and at the end during the last period of class they wouldn't pay attention to the class, because they would feel to tired of had spent almost half-day in school. Then, he really needs to work after school to pay himself. . Therefore four-day school week should not be accepted in my school. Actually, my school should not adopt that kind schedule, because the standard week with eight hours each day increases the productive time, and the standard week allows student to do other activities after school, such as: work, to do homework, sports or even spend more time with family and friends.\n\nThose who believe that the school should changed their schedule from standard five-day work week to a different schedule model that consists of ten hours per day have their reasons. Actually, my school should not adopt this new idea, because the standard week formed by five day of eight hours increases the productive time, and it allows student to do different kind of activities like have a job, homework, play sports or even share time with family. They also think that two extra hours each day are not a big sacrifice, knowing that they are going to have an extended weekend and making the same amount of hours which means the same paycheck amount, and they might have time.\n\nOne reason why the school should not changed their schedule of five-day school week to four-day school week is because, the standard week of five days increases the productive time of each student. If my school adopt this new policy, I wouldn't be able to keep my grades high and I wouldn't pay attention to the last period of class, because by that time I would be tired and bored of have stayed that long and having classes the all day. PROPER_NAME would be involved on a problem, because he wouldn't be able to have a job after school. As example of this is myself.

I bet that you did it, and I'm going show you my point of view of why we should keep having a normal school week of five days instead of a four-day school week.\n\nAlthough some say that my school should adopt a four-day school week by adding two hours each day. Have you ever felt that the weekend isn't enough? that you might wanted to do some kind of activities during weekend, but the time wasn't enough. A perfect example of this is my friend, PROPER_NAME.

You never know truly about something until you experiment it.\n\nIn conclusion, the first day of school where you have to introduce yourself, or being at public place and someone asks you for something in a nice way, what do you think about that person? From first impressions, after seeing that person for the second time you would always go back and think about how the first time went. You can never change your very first thought of someone, it may change later but not the first second of your conversation. On the other hand, there's always an \"i wonder\" question in my mind about everyone, because it's totally normal. They may act shy and make you feel awkward, or they may act friendly and make you feel welcome. Why? imagine meeting a person and the only thing you think about when they cross your mind is the way they first greet you or the way that they introduced themselves to you.\n\nFor instance, in my opinion, i feel that people will always put on a different character for their \"first impression\". With just one impression someone can teach you about themselves a bit, theres no doubt in that.             . What first impression would you get from that person? I would honestly not even bother to talk to them, they could say anything mean to me, But with first impressions changing overtime, you never know once that person starts talking they wont stop smiling or talking. I will always agree with the fact that first impressions are almost impossible to change. I will always agree that it is impossible for first impressions to change because of our natural human traits. Another example could be is getting someone introduced to you from a friend. For example, imagine seeing some person that is always quiet, always seems like their mad or doesn't want to be at the function. First impressions is always something that i pay attention to when meeting a person for the first time. It's fun of how our brains permanently label people from our first impression until it is changed to something else. So, with that saying, you can never change the way you first think of someone, first impressions will always be a permanent statement that your brain can't erase.\n\nAccordingly, if you do have the abilities, you can always tell what type of person they are.

Also, there is Latinos who copy other Latino's accent trying to be cool or staff, and it's not make sense, because that means they do not love their own country and do not have self-steem. Personally, I feel comfortable with the little what I have. For example, if someone say that they like short hair, someone else do it to feel a little bit of atention. What I want to get with that is,that they is another people who do not have atention or love and start doing things to their friend or other people start to pay them atention. Because with that they're showing someone who is not themselves. However, that's no the only thing. How is it? For me, it's like if someone want to be friend, good; if people do not want to meet me, it's ok, too. That means being doble face. And I also start to be neutral. From my point of view, is so stupid. And the most stupid thing is when they show some love to their country and apparent like nothing happen",
      "ai_text": "When someone attempts to appear as something they're not in order to draw others to them, it is important to consider how this relates to self-esteem. Feeling comfortable in a close-knit group can be a key factor in avoiding the need to portray a false persona in order to gain attention.. There may be a fear of rejection or simply a desire to make an impression, but ultimately it is important to recognize the underlying cause. \nGaining attention through pretense is a complicated concept. Pretending to be someone you're not to gain attention can be especially damaging if done by someone of a certain gender or sexual orientation since those people often face greater scrutiny for their behavior. On the other hand, there is also something to be said for keeping a small circle of trusted people in one's personal life. Furthermore, it is necessary to be aware of double standards. It can often be seen as a negative behavior, suggesting a lack of confidence or even a sense of insecurity",

      "human_text": "I can't commit to only one career because there is so many things that I want to do and like to do, for example: When I was 6 years old I liked playing the guitar, I still like to play the guitar but it is no something I want to to as a career. For some people is not easy to stick with something, because they will keep changing their mind.\n\nSince I was young I wanted to do a lot of things in life. . Some drop out of school because it is no something they are interested and probably it's something they are not good at and give up. When she was in high school the career that she is in right now wasn't something that she wanted because she didn't like it, she does now, but she wants to do other things. Since there is not only one thing I like to do I can't commit to only one thing in life and If i do commit, later in life I will probably regret doing it.\n\nThere are many students at my age that really don't want to do anything with their life or they don't have the ability do it. At 3 years old I loved to dance, it is something that I will always like to do but that is not something that I see myself doing for the rest of my life. Most of them just want to stay home and do nothing. Students shouldn't commit to a career, because they can change their mind, they are not good at only one thing or they don't want to do anything.\n\nA lot of people I know keep changing their mind, they are not ready to keep doing only one thing for the rest of their lives. And when I was 10 years old I started to draw, I started by drawing animals or any cartoon character, but now I draw whatever comes to my mind, however, it is not something I want to keep doing. They stay at their parents house, which is not bad, but they stay there and do not look for any job. Do you think that all students have the capacity to commit to a career at a young age? In this paper I will argue about how students do not have the ability to commit to a career at a young age. At a young age not all students can do a career. Some look for jobs but it is not something they like, it is something that is easy and can get them money to survive.\n\nSome say that all students can commit to a career, but they are wrong because not all students have the same mind sets as other students. My sister is an example: She is now almost about to finish her career but she wants to leave it because now she is interested in another thing. In the future most of the students wont want to stick to only one career because they wouldn't only like one thing, so they should decide when they are ready and really know that the career that they are choosing will be the one that wont get tired of doing it",
      "ai_text": "In fact, many students do not have the ability to commit to a career path at such a young age. This indicates that career commitment does not come quickly nor easily; rather, it is a process which takes time and exploration of various interests and potential opportunities.\n\nMoreover, young people are still developing their skills, values, and interests\u2014all of which can greatly influence job choice. This can be attributed to several factors.\n\nFirst, students are often still exploring their interests and trying to find their specialties in order to decide which field or profession to pursue. The Department of Labor\u2019s Transition and Career Explorations Toolkit states that \u201cstudents must be able to identify and explore their individual, career-related preferences and interests before they can begin to consider and make informed career choices\u201d. With time, research, exploration, and advisement, however, students can easily develop a deeper understanding of available career paths and come to an informed decision.. This process can take time and often involves trying out a variety of experiences, such as volunteer work, internships, and educational courses. This is due to a combination of factors, ranging from a still-developing skillset to a changing job market to identifying personal interests. \nIt is common for high school and college students to feel uncertain about their future careers. This further suggests that young individuals may not be sufficiently informed or knowledgeable about a given field or profession in order to make a career commitment.\n\nIn conclusion, it is understandable why so many students lack the ability to commit to a career at a young age. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, most individuals work an average of 12 different jobs throughout their lives, with the average person spending almost five years in each job. Additionally, in an ever-changing economy, the job market may be in flux, which can make it difficult to determine where to invest time and resources.\n\nLabour market research further evidences this point",

      "human_text": "The satisfaction of telling yourself that it is over and summer is coming, there are no more worries about next day because you have fought for eight months to pass it. Believing in yourself is feeling confident. If you study for a long time then when the time arrives, you will feel ready to pass it. First, people have to have self-esteem in order to work hard and learn new things every day or once in a while. Thank you!!. Learning a new language, being someone who knows Spanish and want to learn English is pretty hard. Hope you enjoy this and it will be helpful for your day. Your confidence will grow high because if you did it at a first try then you can do anything that you feel afraid of. When the final days of school comes and the exams and SOL arrive slowly and you are feeling unprepared for it. Do you feel confident comes from achievement or for praise? People are concern about the students must be self-confident in order to learn and other thinks that self-esteem come after you achieve something. One word in English might mean five different words in Spanish and some words aren't even similar. Make the confident to cover your fear and be sure what you are doing. The confident that you put yourself every day to come to school even if you feel bad is the one who will keep all your information and it will help you in your nightmares that is those big tests. Nobody was born with the intelligent to get something form the beginning. SOL is a good example of it; teachers prepared us for about eight months to pass a test that is no that long, the problem is that it's not just one SOL but many of it no including the exams. Learning a new job it's so frustrate because at the beginning you won't have any idea on what you are doing. People might think a lot of things but this is my opinion; to achieve something you have to be full of self-confident. Positive people always think that everything will go right and they tell themselves that they will end up knowing this job like their own hands. Some examples could be people have to have self-esteem in order to work hard and learn new things every day or once in a while, people have to be confident and positive in order to get something done, and confident is feeling sure about what you are about to do.\n\nSucceeding in something is a great achievement but if there is no confident how can you be sure what you. When you are learning to walk for the first time, you fall and fall until your knees get red and even end up with blood but after all that effort comes the realize that now you don't depend on them to get something because now you can do it by your own. Let's pretend that you pass it in the first try, well, you achieved it and you are happy because it's over and now you are getting closer to get a car and drive by your own. My solution is to have confident in yourself. Why? Because they have confidence that they can do anything if they fight for it. You have to make a mix of all the things you have to include to get it. For example, anger doesn't let someone to concentrate and it lead to chaos. They won't choose you if they feel you are not really and no have confident to do well the job.\n\nHowever other people think that self-esteem come from achievement. You will never gonna to achieve to learn the whole language no even the native can but you will build a confident inside yourself knowing that you will never going to be done with it but you will be learning everyday new words. When trying to find a new job at any place but you don't know how is going to be like or how they are going to receive you. When you pass something, you achieve it somehow. If something is achieved then the fear will go away and the confident will stay forever. Secondly, after achieving something, usually that person feels joyous for the reality that it's over. For instance, in all the world there are always different kinds of people: positive and negative. Because you won't have any clue about what is going to happen in that first meeting and those people who will hired you have to feel like you are really to do the job. Why? Some words might mean the same as the do in English but all of them do. You have to be sure about yourself and letting your confident falls over your fears because with fear nothing is possible. When you are at school, it is so easy for old people to think that students just have the obligation of going to school and nothing more at all. For example, if you study so hard for the driving test the night before and feel like you know you are going pass it. However I still believe that confident have to come before the achievement because confident is courage that every person put itself into his or her heart to full-fill the fear.\n\nAs previously stated, things cannot be achieve if there is no confident on it. To begin with by achieving something, you are getting what you fought for and self-confident come as the result. But what if the SOL is failed twice won't that prejudice your next year. Studying it's not just passing classes but it's about learning things for the next day. That's happiness in yourself but what is you fail, all the effort for the last night is not over yet because you have to do it again until you pass it. For example, achieving something is no that easy. Secondly, you have to be confident and positive in order to get something done. Lastly, a positive person is someone who is full of joy and feels confident for what it wants and it's there to fight until it's achieve it. Thirdly, confident is feeling sure about what you are about to do. For instance, there are some jobs like a doctor they never stop learning new things because at some moment a new disease will appear and new medicine will developed. People need self-esteem in order to function at work and keep learning, the confident and positively that is in every person will make possible for them to get things done, and confident is a feeling of courage that makes the fear goes away",
      "ai_text": "When we don\u2019t believe in ourselves, we may doubt our potential and give up on our ambitions. This raises the question of whether having self-confidence before achieving a goal or experience is necessary for our success.\n\nI believe that having self-confidence is the first step of all achievers, big or small. An entrepreneur may forgo a promising opportunity out of fear of failure because they lack self-confidence. It is the all-important catalyst that helps us to move forward with our goals, despite the odds. \nConfidence is an important factor when it comes to achieving anything\u2014whether it is in our personal or professional lives. For example, an aspiring author may be confident in their abilities to write a book, even if they don\u2019t have any published works yet. Having confidence in oneself gives us the motivation and drive to strive for what we want in life, even when the odds are against us. This would lead to missed opportunities and ultimately, leads to an unfulfilled life.\n\nIn conclusion, for any achievements\u2014big or small\u2014self-confidence is the key. Without it, we may lack the necessary drive to see our aspirations through.. With self-confidence, we can stay motivated and persevere in the pursuit of our goals. They will be encouraged to keep going and stay motivated because of their internal belief in their skills.\n\nOn the other hand, lacking confidence can lead to a negative attitude towards achieving goals",

In order to graduate she need to pass her English SOL. Because she never try to do it. While she was talking, one of her friend interrupted her. And then they can become successful on thier life.\n\nOverall, without loss of enthusiasm people can reach their goal by failure. And said that, he was satisfied with her math. For to become success, people need to learn from failure and they have to try again and again. For example, Generic_Name is senior of Generic_School. For example, Generic_Name told her friend that she is good at Science and English. \"Failure is not the worst thing, not to try is worst thing in the world.\" To become successful, people must try.

They should not give up. Which can take them one step ahead of their goal.\n\nFurthermore, failure can make people successful in their life. First she was saying that she doesn't know how to do it. From failure people can learn more about themselves. And then after this, she got to realize that she know how to solve the equation problem. As a result, she pass her English SOL this time. If people fail and grow up without losing hope, they can be successful in their future. Some people who fail on first time can also prepare themselves for next time. To reach a goal, people need to pass the small steps first. After test correction, she got to understand what she missed. But this time she tried her best with positive energy and she didn't gave up.

So, here is when we need the help from experts and not take the decison of creating the restaurant by ourself. Also, it can help us to make better decison trought life and make us a better person.\n\nReason 2\n\nBad decison can hurt ourself. They have to do alot to become a teacher in that career. Those people that we call experts know alot more then us because they have graduated from it. So, there is times where we make bad choices. One good example could be when we are tenergers. In some points we have to be strong but to take any decision we need to be social, what I mean by it is to ask for help and make good decision.. that way we can subcess in life. They want the best for us, so they will teach us what could be the best and what have to really matter is this life because they love us. There is times that we think we are right in every decision that we make. However, we have to know that no one is perfect as a human. for that type of decision we just have to think about who we are hurting too, and as we know it is ourself and nobody else. However ther are decison that cna hurt ourself and can take us to do something stupid in life. So, it can be really helpful for us to subceed because they have been studying for years their career. sometimes we need to acept that we can do it by ourself and thet we need help from experts or our patrents. However there is some decision that we can take by ourself. introduction\n\nThe people who value selft-reliance should seek guidance from experts and authorities,\n\ninstead of taking their own decision about life's important matters. They know everyhting about business and what could be best for us. if we don't take about ourself and the decision thaty we make nobody will.\n\nReason 1\n\nIn my opinion self-reliance is really important in every single person life. some people don't take sometime to think about the consecuences of creating a restaurant. Also, we can learn how to be responsable in the decison that we make. For example, we can choose if we want to drink alcohol, and smoke. They don't think about the things that they have to pay out from the money that they are making of the restaurant. They don't think about that they can lose all their money if the restaurant doesn't work. Howevere, we don't need to wait untill that happen better look for experts, so they can help us to make good decision and not bad decision two heads are better ten one.\n\nconclusion\n\nIn conclution the help from experts is the best way to do the things. At that time is when we need help from experts and what better experts then our parents. When we talk about Self-reliance is about decision. For example, a person want to nibest money to create a restaurant. So, we can subcess in business life and don't lose money.\n\ncounterclima.\n\nSomeone would argue that making decison by ourself is better because that way we won't have to blame on anybody if we make bad decision. When we say experts we are talking about people that know alot more about the topic then us. They can teach us how to be better and thats why they have been created in this world to look for them and ask for help. We have to look for different sources to subcess in life. At first it sound good because what we all think is that we only win in this type of business, but the reallity is that it could be like a challange for the person. it could be good or bad decision or sometimes there are some decision that look good, but it could take us to do something bad. When it happens that people lose all their money they can get depress, and some of them have even take their life. Also, we can look for another type of experts who can be profesional and have a diploma in what they are experts in. at that age is when we need more help than anything because there is alot of things that can influenciate us really easy.

Additionally, in order to achieve goals, it is important to focus on the overall goal rather than on small failures along the way, and to maintain a mindset that is open to learning and is driven by enthusiasm.

I responded back to Generic_Name's text, and without realizing we kept on messaging past midnight. I remember in my sophomore year a kid in our econ class named Generic_Name was really sick for a while so he had ended up taking classes online. Generic_Name was a straight A student, always was first to answer the teachers questions and he also used to ask questions. Generic_Name explained that he always faced technical difficulties.    . Learning from a far distance could also be an option but when asking if it is beneficial, we can say that it is not by looking at the listed reasoning. The next morning I decided to get to school an hour early and review one on one with my teacher.\n\nSecondly, taking classes online doesn't just mean you don't have a physical teacher or instructor that you can question lively, but also means that it will be challenging to find answers to your questions. You can't always depend on your computer, not just the computers but even people aren't perfect. The straight A student Generic_Name said it was a real challenge to take the class online and he finished the class a month after he should have with a B- average. When his laptop wasn't functioning right, the only thing he could do was to stop the lesson and wait for his dad to get the laptop repaired, which took time. Generic_Name had also said that one of the most difficult parts about attending a class online was his laptop not functioning at all times, and not having a teacher you can talk and converse with one on one.\n\nFinally, using your personal computer and internet connection can always be an issue. This shows how easily students get distracted at home with a cellular device and how easy it is to lose focus. It is not beneficial to learn online because students lose focus of what they are learning and tend to easily get distracted when they're in their house, students can't have a one on one conversation with a teacher nor discuss with classmates, and students could also face technical difficulties when attending online classes from home.\n\nLosing focus has a big impact in learning. Each month, either his laptop or internet connection would not cooperate, so he finished the class a month later than everyone.\n\nIn conclusion, Everyone would like to save money and time by taking classes from home. Online Learning\n\nWho doesn't want to be left in the house all day using an electronic device with online access? Although students save money and time by taking classes from home. For example, my friend Generic_Name sent me a text message last month, right when I started studying for my history mid-term exam. But getting distracted, not asking your teacher questions when you need to, and wasting money on laptop repair is not worth it at all. Thankfully Generic_Name healed towards the end of the year and I asked him if he benefited and if he recommends attending classes from home",

Additionally, when learning online, students may find it more difficult to stay focused on the task at hand. Additionally, online learning programs are often more affordable than traditional on-campus courses.\n\nIn conclusion, online learning offers a range of advantages and disadvantages. Additionally, software or unanticipated technical problems can prevent students from accessing their materials, leading to difficulties in completing coursework.\n\nDespite these disadvantages, there are many benefits to online learning. Without access to a reliable internet connection, or even a laptop, it can be difficult for students to complete their work in a timely manner. When considering online coursework, students should weigh both the positives and negatives in order to make an informed decision on the best learning option for their particular situation..

Solar energy is now about as cheap as energy from fossil fuels, and in some parts of the world, it is even cheaper. \nThe world is in dire need of renewable energy sources. This is critical because many areas of the world are experiencing water shortages. For these reasons, it should be the priority of governments and businesses to invest in renewable energy sources in order to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and create more sustainable forms of energy.. \n\nOne major argument in favor of renewable energy stems from its clean energy production. \n\nFinally, renewable energy sources offer numerous economic, social, and environmental benefits. Renewable energy can help reduce emissions and tackle global warming. On the environmental side, renewable energy sources help mitigate climate change, reduce air pollution, and decrease the extraction of finite fossil fuels like coal and oil. By investing in renewable energy sources, governments and businesses can reduce their energy costs in the long run. Wind energy is also an extremely clean source of energy, and both solar and wind energy have much lower carbon footprints than fossil fuels. Wind power is also much cheaper than solar power and is now competitive with natural gas. For instance, renewable energy is often \u201cdistributed\u201d or generated at the point of use, creating jobs in rural and less developed areas.

Around the world, there are people that accomplished alot, always by doing something, and not by doing nothing. More is always done when we do what we need to do, other wise we get lazy and say \"I'll do it tommorow\". Steve Jobs didnt wait to do something for himslef, he dropped out of college, but it didn't stop him from doing what he wanted to after that. to conclude my essay, we should always do something the moment we get the task, other wise it will never be done..

It's good to have a mindset where you like to get stuff done, that shows that youre an honest person, and it can really say alot about a person. These two Entremreneurs are great examples of doing something, great should come. They both worked so hard for their companys, not waiting a day for something to be complete. When we dont do anything get stressed out, and worry about it to much, more then we're suppose to. So we have to get stuff done so we won't have to worry or stress about it later. We never know if tommorow will ever come for us to do the tasks that could be important. A couple of years later Apple came to be to what it is today, Steve Jobs worked hard to get his company to where is today, by working hard and not by doing nothing, but by always doing something. Doing nothing will not get anyhting done, neither will waiting. Bill Gates was always busy doing something to get stuff done for a company, now he's the owner for Microsoft.

Long ten hours in school might be uncomfortable for the students, who do extra curriculum activities like preparing courses, art clubs and sports. How to distribute forty work hours a week most usefully? Nowadays, a four-day work week is very rare, because this system is new; people always being careful when something new come out, but then they understand it is better. However, our school has all comfortabilities to do extra curriculum activities inside the school's building, so the students do not need to go anywhere else.\n\nTo conclude, the four-day school week seems experimental for people yet; but when something new is thought the people realize an idea is innovative, then the idea becomes an action, which becomes regular. School days will be very busy, hard; but maybe more educational and efficient. The school would use less electricity to heat and cool the building; it will spent less money for servicing the students and investigate saved money to science researches, equipment and study program development.\n\nThird, with the sour-day schedule the pupils become more free: they might share more time with their family and friends; spent more time for their hobbies and working. This is why, I believe, our school should should follow the new schedule.\n\nFirst, the forty-day school week is more well-distributed, because the students would have more time for rest, doing homework; so their ability to study will have been raised. On another hand, ten hours in school might be exhausting for the pupils, but the school administration may make breaks longer and more frequent to solve the problem of tired students\n\nSecond, the four-day schedule lowers the use of energy and resources.   .

While there are certainly pros and cons to this idea, it's important to consider the practicality of this idea from the perspectives of the student, parent, and administration. \n\nPros of a four-day school week include having more time for students to focus on extracurricular activities, reduced stress by having a longer weekend, and less overall cost for the school district. Cons include increased difficulty for parents to find childcare during the extended school day, potential loss of lessons due to compressed school days, and difficulty for students to keep up with amount of content presented in less time",

All in all,people always has to make a good impression the first time and they will have better opportunities.\n\nHowever, some people may argue that first impressions can be change because people may have regrets and they will try to apply themselves and do their best in what they did wrong in the past .This argument is weak though because not everything in life can be change easily. For instance, some people that apply to a job but they did not present on time will give their new boss a bad impression about them that he or she will want to fire them. In a word, a good impression the first time will save people from trouble.\n\nPeople always have to be careful in what they show or do the first time. Should the first impressions care and show who individuals are? First impressions are almost impossible to change that is why people always have to worry about their actions because people can not go back the time, can lose opportunities, and can get on trouble.\n\nFirst of all, people can not go back the time and try to fix what they had done wrong. All in all, people have to do their best the first time even if life is too difficult because time does not come back.\n\nIn addition, Individuals can lose opportunities by their first impressions. Even though, first impressions are impossible to change because no all the time people will have the opportunities to a second chance.\n\nFinally, people can get on trouble for how they show the first time. For example, some individuals who gave a bad impression in their first time at work because they did not how to deal with the costumer and they had a bad attitude but then the next day they realized that they have to change their attitude it may be too late because the costumers already complained. There are great reasons for always make a good impression the first time because individuals can not go back the time,can lose opportunities, and can get on trouble.

Neglecting to create a successful first impression can lead to major missed opportunities, or even worse, trouble further down the line.. People cannot go back and change a poor first impression, so it is key to make sure to leave a strong and positive one the first time. People need to be aware that bad first impressions can have serious consequences, even if they think they can work their way out of the initial poor opinion later. Not appearing to be someone of value and positive standing can quickly result in the loss of a lucrative opportunity.

For example nova is an academic instutude collage that has a lot of benifits for students such as saving money for collage. For example if students don't have a high GPA, the most common thing that would happen would be that they will be rejected by a lot of collages. students will also have good grades and apportunities for them to get a scholarship and have a higher GPA that would help them attened the collage they want to go to. At nova they prepare students to when they are ready to move on to a four year collage but you need to have a good GPA and have all the requirements that nova asks for.\n\nHowever not everyone agrees that atteneding to school is benificial for students. would it be the same if you learn all the materials by watching videos?. a video only summarize the story comapring to when you're in class you can ask questions and also have more information from your teacher. but the question is \"do you have the money to pay collage?\". Having a teacher explalining you everything and working with other students can help your grade and also your GPA for you to attened to good collages and be able to have a lot of advantages.\n\nStudents will have more benefits and advantages of learning the materials, if they atten to school. Having a high GPA can help you get into good collages without having to pay and you can also earn money while you're attending collage. Students also don't agree about having good grades and a good GPA. some students think that having to show up to school is a waste of time and that it would be better if they learn by looking tutorials on youtube or being able to attend classes from home. would you be able to ask questions just the same way other students do?. Making a decision of taking class from home can make a huge impact in your life and the future.

For example students think that they can still go to the collages they want to attened without matter of there grades and GPA that all they had to do is pay. students will be able to graduate early from collage and with a really high degree that could benefit them by finding job where they start at the top like others professionals people.\n\nStudents will struggle a lot looking for collages that are not too expensive or collages that can help them save money. For example a high schooler that takes classes online that wants to be a history teacher they can struggle a lot because a video can't give you enough information, for you to know the story.

By taking classes remotely, a student might gain the opportunity to hold a job, whereas if they were in a physical classroom, they might be too restricted.\n\nWhen considering the student view, learning from home can have a greater impact on mental health. It's important to consider not only the academic prospects, but also factors such as ease of learning and how their mental health and comfort may be affected in each situation.. In terms of GPA, attending school provides students with more access to in-person resources such as tutoring and other forms of academic help from teachers or fellow students. In addition, attending physical classes requires more preparedness, as well as having to wear a mask and adhere to other protocols depending on the area. However, attending school is also important for developing study habits and discipline.\n\nWhen looking at both the pros and cons, the approach which is more beneficial for learning history and other required school subjects might ultimately depend on the students themselves and the situation. Real-world examples such as the ability to live in a college and work while attending do exist, and this approach can be beneficial for a student trying to balance multiple responsibilities or who prefers a flexible learning schedule. For those easily distracted by the presence of others, home learning can be less stressful.

Some people dont change and that happens to thats how the world works. This is why I think we choose our character traits.\n\nFor example, I think we choose our character traits like being quiet. Some people also think thats our character traits are influence beyond our control, and yes I can see there point of view because, when I screamed and yelled when I scored or won I game i didnt control it i just yelled. and even discover new things. Sometimes I even screamed and yelled of happiness because I scored or won a game. like being confident or keeping yourself in check thats a good trait to have. Thats why I think we choose our character traits like being quiet.\n\nAlso, another example is being social. A British naturalist and politician John Lubbock wrote, \"Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it.\" Do we choose our character traits, or our character forms by influences beyond our control? I think we can control our character traits because we can choose our character traits like being quiet, being social, and being over yourself. This is why I think we can choose our character traits like being over yourself.\n\nFinally, I think when the British naturalist and politician John Lubbock wrote, \"Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it.\" He though one of two things he thought we choose our character traits, or our character forms by influences beyond our control. I was a very talkative kid in 7th to 8th grade I remember that I felt like I was annoying to some people because i talked a lot. I could've not yelled I could've just celebrated with my hands and look up in the sky but I didnt do that. Being social is a great thing to have because talking to people is good like you can make friends, learn new things. I felt so alone because of that, then I started talking to people and got lots of friends. I discover new things to like I discover that people can change over time. Thats why I think we can control and choose our character traits like being social.\n\nTherefore, my next example is being a over yourself. I also learned new things like how to approach and talk to people. You have to balance it all out. Being quiet isnt a good or bad thing like you can be quiet sometimes not all the time because you got to talk once in a while. I remember back when i was i middle school 6th to 7th grade I was a quiet kid with little friends like I would not talk to no one. This is why I think he thought about we choose our character traits.. I think he thought we choose our character traits like being quiet, being social, and being over yourself. Some are nice then they turn moody or mean, and others were mean then nice. It can be also a bad trait because you can be over confident and cocky. So, I think we can control our character traits",
      "ai_text": "Although not every person will make the same decision, these kinds of choices are made by many individuals in different situations.\n\nMoreover, researchers have found that even seemingly unchangeable traits, such as extroversion and introversion, can be taken on through conscious effort over time. Many of us believe that these traits can be changed and altered based on our decisions and choices. \nCharacter traits are essential components of our personalities and identity. For example, an introverted person can choose to become more extroverted by making small changes to their behavior and gradually expanding their social circle. It's certainly possible for us to choose to be quiet in certain social settings, or to be more social in other settings. \n\nTo begin, let's consider the role of choice in determining personality traits. \n\nIn conclusion, it is possible to choose our character traits, and although the changes may take some time, they are definitely within our control. Similarly, a person can choose to focus on themselves and their own wellbeing rather than serve the needs of others. In doing so, we also have the power to shape our identities according to the character traits we choose.. In this way, our character traits are not necessarily predetermined by our genetic makeup, but can be altered through a combination of conscious effort and personal choice. Likewise, an extroverted person can choose to become more introverted by limiting their social engagements and doing more activities alone. In this way, our level of sociability can be determined by our choice in the moment. Whether we choose to be quiet or social, or to focus on ourselves or others, it is all determined by the choices we make. But is this something that is within our control? In this essay, I will discuss the idea that we can choose our character traits, and explore whether we can exercise discretion over traits such as being quiet, being social, and being over oneself",

His ability to continue in the face of adversity is an example of Churchill's embodiment of his own famous phrase and reinforces the notion of success stemming from the persistence of enthusiasm. Although his party was soundly defeated, Churchill did not lose his enthusiasm and instead chose to continue fighting for the causes he believed in. His resilience in these moments of failure, such as sticking to his guns when delivering his iconic ironic proverb in the middle ofpolitcal chaos, is a testament to his ability to stay motivated despite trying times. \n\nFor example, Churchill's political career was fraught with several failure, most notably his losing the 1945 general election despite his tremendous effort in leading the country during World War II. \n\nIn addition to his politics, Churchill's record-breaking writing career was filled with hurdles.

Although some might believe, asking for help (guidance), talking to your priors or family members, having confidence in yourself proves seeking for guidance from experts and authorities about life important matters is a good idea.\n\nAsking for help and guidance. Anybody can overcome the fear of speaking just by talking with your family first then friends and people you don't know.\n\nWhats important is that you learn to talk to people like your family, friends, and your school administrators. That means it is a good idea to ask experts at finding the right college for you.\n\nTalking to your priors, family members and communicating. People who don't communicate will always have a tough time talking to people, they will be really quiet and lonely at times. There was a guy who decided to eat a ghost pepper because of a dare and next thing you know it they are in the hospital, not so good isnt it. Some people have a bad past in speaking to one another but it all comes down to are you going to make a change because that person who has difficulties in speaking, doesn't like it either. I always ask my friends and family what to do for certain things such as what classes do you think seem good that I also like or what sport should I join and try out.    . One of my good friends named Generic_Name came to Generic_school awhile back all quiet and had a soft voice until he started talking to people like his friends and family everyday, now it sounds like he is a whole different person and he is way more confident in public speaking. If you start communicating and talking a lot more, it will build up confidence to the point where you won't be nervous to talk in front of a class. This relates to stuff in a political aspect basically media because people on there need to speak to one hundred million of people out in the world on TV. This relates to talking to priors and family members and communicating because they are here to help you out no matter what.\n\nHaving confidence in yourself. I told him to go talk to your counselor and now he's now in Generic_school because he asked about what colleges seem good and are better for Generic_Name. My friend Generic_Name was having a tough time choosing which college he wants to go to. One day one of my friends Generic_Name from a while back lets say elementary school, Generic_Name was eating lunch and some kid came by and swiped his tray off the table, he wanted to beat they other person up and I said no I suggest you go talk to a teacher about it. I want people to overcome their fear of communicating in the future because that's a big deal if you don't, many jobs out they need people to speak well with other folks. I think communicating is great because it sets a good outlook on your personality. This relates to asking for help because he had no idea where he wanted to go if he made the decision to go some college, having no background knowledge of the school and he got there noticed its not for me, he is screwed. That's how you make more friends like you want to know what good advice they can give you and you can give them",

Learning to ask for advice or help can be invaluable when making decisions. By speaking to family members and friends, Obama's mother had the guidance needed to make the right decisions. Prior generations can provide valuable insights and wisdom, while family members can both support and supply guidance. Whether the advice comes from prior generations, family members, or other trusted confidants, having the support surrounding us helps us have the confidence to make the right choice.. \n\nIn the political realm, President Obama discussed the importance of asking for help when making decisions. In the episode, the protagonist struggles to choose between two career paths and ultimately relies on family members to provide guidance. I was uncertain which was best, but after speaking to an older colleague I found the confidence to trust my own judgement. \n\nI personally experienced the importance of asking for help when deciding between two job offers. Obama referenced this when he told a story about his mother's life, and how she leaned on her community for support when making important choices",

Do you agree or disagree with \"imagination is more important than knowledge\"? I agree with this statement because it helps you when your reading books, studying, and learning. Comedy books are one of my favorite to read because it cheers me up more than anything beside music. Imagining helps me learn more because I am a slow learner I don't learn fast like other kids do so I like to sit down and imagine all the things the teacher was talking about so I can catch up with the class.\n\nAlso, Imagination helps me a lot when it comes to studying because I am not good at remembering things. English is more of smart people stuff I get so lost in English because we do a lot of work at once and the confuses me.

It is all imagination it helps a lot of people each and everyday by studying, learning or reading books because I enjoy it a lot it helps me fill up my emptiness.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree imagination is more important than knowledge because it a it of people just like it helps me. Some people take learning as a joke but I take it seriously because I want my dreams to come true I always wake up in the morning happy to go to school to learn something new. I learn more when I imagine things at school or other places.\n\nTo begin with, I like reading books because it helps me when I'm mad or just in general. Learning is important it helps people get to where they want to be either it's a dream, a location or read and write things. Studying is not my thing yet because there are big words I don't understand especially when it comes to English and math.

It provides an invaluable resource when seeking to understand something or solve a problem.\n\nTake reading books for example. Imagination opens up the ability to apply the knowledge I have acquired in creative and innovative ways.\n\nThe power of imagination cannot be overstated. Imagination allows us to go beyond the facts and move into understanding. \n\nThis same benefit of imagination carries over to my studies and learning. It is only through imagination that I can truly engage and explore an idea. However, for me, imagination has proven to be even more valuable. Knowledge increases our understanding of the world and our ability to navigate it. It is my imagination that helps me to open up possibilities, to connect ideas, to think outside the box, and to see the bigger picture or benefit.

It allows us to stand out from the crowd, to be seen and heard, and to express who we truly are.\n\nThe primary advantage of being true to ourselves is that we can make sure our choices are based on our own values and beliefs. We can take pride in our authentic selves, rather than being a clone of what society expects us to be. This can increase our self-esteem and strengthen our confidence, allowing us to face life with more courage and positivity.\n\nThe primary disadvantage of being true to oneself is that it means going against the grain. We can become a target for bullying or mockery if we express our opinions openly and honestly. We may face criticism or disapproval from others, or be excluded from certain social circles. Having the strength to stand against the tide and remain true to ourselves can be the greatest victory of all.. Our authenticity is ours and ours alone \u2013 something that no one else can take away from us. On the other hand, remaining true to ourselves can be incredibly liberating. Additionally, it can be difficult to remain true to ourselves when faced with peer pressure or when around people who don\u2019t have the same values.\n\nOverall, being true to oneself in a world trying to make us someone else can be a challenging yet rewarding journey",

      "human_text": "I know that if we shorten the summer break we will have a longer winter break, but that is not the case for the country that does not have a winter break or a week off in fall and spring. So if I can visit my family this year, I might have to wait a few years later to be able to visit them again.\n\nSecondly, this is a period of time where students can do whatever thay want to do like doing some volunteering or club activities or playing sports or just simply doing their favorite hobbies. If we shorten the summer break, students will easily get bored when they come back to school because they do not have enough time to do what they like in summer. To be able to come back to Generic_City it is not just about time, sometimes it could involve money. Some students, like me, came from another country so a lot of times we do miss our hometown. Nobody wants to study when they are bored. One of my Vietnamese friend told me that even in summer he still have to take a lot of tutor classes. Students need to have some times to release their stress after a long year at school by visiting their family or doing whatever they like.. So if we want a student to return to school with lots of energy, we need to let them have a break. That is why having a three month summer break is truly a huge chance for us because that is pretty much the only reunion we have in a year. That is why if we shorten the summer break then lots and lots of Asian students will not even have time to do what they love!\n\nLast but not least, learning too much might be something that some students could not handle. Very stressful! Not to mention that Asian students usually have a shorter summer break and winter break.\n\nOn the whole, I am not agree with this idea and along with fact that I am an Asian and I used to go through a very strict and tough education in Asia, I can never accept this. A lot of students suicide just because of learning too much. Just check some examples on the news or internet, especially in South Korea or Japan. I will take mine as an example. Too many homeworks and tests, pressures from parents and teacher,.... The ticket is just too expensive, not to mention that it is in summer. A short summer break meaning we have to go to school more than we need. Summer is the time for students to take a break from school, but some educators feel that summer break is too long and it needs to be shorten. And that give me an example. A student could get stress if they do not have a proper break. As for me, I am strongly disagree with this idea because summer is the time for student to visit their famiy, their relatives, to do whatever they like, to enjoy whatever they love and sometimes learning too much might be somthing that some students could not handle.\n\nFirst of all, summer is the time for students to come back to their hometown to visit their family",
      "ai_text": "All of these experiences contribute to a learning experience that is valuable in its own right, and cutting short summer break would severely limit these experiences for students from different countries. \n\nFor those in an education system with short or no winter and spring breaks, the summer serves as both a time of rest and renewal. A shortened summer break would not only be detrimental to students' physical and mental health but would deprive them of invaluable experiences that come from exploring different cultures and places.. \nSummer break in many countries is a much-needed time of rest and relaxation for students and educators alike. Shortening the summer break would be a disservice to students, particularly those coming from a different country, or those in an education system with short or no winter and spring breaks. Without these additional breaks, students are more likely to suffer from burnout due to the constant pressure of learning and academic expectations. For many people, this break acts not just as a chance to take a breather, but a catalyst to explore new ideas, cultures, and opportunities. It is an important opportunity for students from different countries as well as those within the education system who experience short or no winter and spring breaks. On the other hand, those who have the luxury of summer break often make time to explore other cultures, visit new places, and pursue interests that are not possible during the school year. \n\nIn conclusion, summer break should not be shortened. \n\nOne common issue among students from different countries is the lack of a traditional \u201csummer holiday.\u201d In many countries, students work longer hours during the summer months and are not able to enjoy the freedom and relaxation of a summer break. A long summer break allows students to take a step back and relax, enabling them to re-enter the school year feeling refreshed and ready to learn",

Certain subject periods may become uninteresting after critically focusing time upon them, and other periods may become shorter in order to cope the extension of time. However, negative concepts can still be present with the solutions, which may indicate that no matter what may be of the scenario, unproductive elements can still remain.\n\nAs previously mentioned, I take a view that is against the prolongment of the academic schedule as it relates to incompatibilities for multiple individuals, an increase in negativity, and the current time frame and activities of school.\n\nOnce again, parents and guardians may have to reduce time at their positions in order to cope with shift of schedule. It can determine how a future employee may react to a circumstance or perhaps how they may solve it. The current schedule alone has multitudes of events, activities, and concepts that are brimming in attentiveness and consumption. A prolonged schedule can be excellent for the further study of a subject as well as direct application. . My perspective on the circumstance is that the school board should not increase the school's schedule due to the following: the current schedule already establishes 7 hours of probable physical and intellectual progression, students can experience more unproductive and negative entities, and that the addition of one and a half hours may produce incompatibilities towards both student and related individual schedules.\n\nBeginning with the 7-hour process, students enter the building and perhaps have already encountered a dilemma. Students can have extracurricular activities that can require adequate time to function properly such as baseball and/or team swimming. A select few could include having to finish more assignments, receiving an increase of homework, and quite more. Entire generations have been based upon education. In essence, a student's day can be of highly troubling challenges as well as instances that an be excessively stressful in relation to the students alone.\n\nWith the prolonging of the day present, multiple casual difficulties may be amplified whilst new forms of faults can be felt by many students. All of this has possibly resulted in the world we exist in today. The people apparent within the school and to some degree outside of it could be left with the severe imbalance of two correlating but differed schedules they must interact with.\n\nThough a multitude of negative concepts and events may be associated with the topic of extending the day, there are quite in fact a variety of benefits to such a transformation. Being Against An Extended School Day\n\n-\n\nGeneric_Name\n\nEducation can be considered to have an immense and influential extent over the preparation of individuals within the constantly expanding world. Events that have a possibility of occurring throughout the day can be unintentionally imposing and certain situations may very well be perceived by an array of people as impossible to conclude with the aforementioned extension.\n\nA final note pertaining to the topic is that a longer daily routine may lead to extensive conflict with faculty, student, guardian time frames. Fundamentals such as algebra and language skills learned by these individuals have sculpted the process for man to touch the Moon and to cease global crises. Homework and subject directives may become more significant in amount and requirement, perhaps stressing the students and teachers to quite the degree. Afterwards, they could be in their classes trying to understand how a certain concept functions with another and may simultaneously be attempting to concluded a page of homework. Socialization in lunch and gym sessions could be extended. The parents and guardians of the students may now not have time to fulfill their career schedules in order to react with their children and could result in negative consequences.\n\nFaculty members may have to stay a longer duration to cleanse or conclude their occupational duties because of the excess of materials and activities. Certain peers may have caught the bus late or arrived earlier than allowed to. Moving from class periods to lunch, they may find themselves perplexed at what they are going to do with their locker's present condition. Benefits and negatives of the school lengthening its duration are and can be present, but truly take into consideration what a change in a time frame could result in; its impacts can be irreversibly.

Parents, guardians, and teachers would all have to adjust their schedules in order to accommodate a longer school day, which could create a strain due to the need for additional childcare options. \n\nThe idea of implementing an extended school day is an attractive but often negative prospect, as it could lead to fatigue and decreased enthusiasm for learning, as well as an overall decrease in academic performance.

These activities can not only give young people the opportunity to express their creativity, but can also help to sustain their mental health. \n\nHowever, it is also important to touch upon the potential drawbacks to taking music, drama, and arts classes. Without encouragement from their parents to try new things and promote confidence, students may not have the confidence to try out these activities or feel comfortable enough to do so. For instance, these activities can be time-consuming and can take away from time that students could have spent on schoolwork. Furthermore, there is often an intimidating element that comes with these types of performances; having an audience can be difficult for some students, especially those who are more introverted. \n\nImportantly, parental support plays a critical role in the success of taking these activities. Drama classes can also offer invaluable opportunities to practice interpersonal communication skills such as public speaking, as well as giving students an opportunity to build confidence and find their own creative voice.

What is simile? well simile is when there is like or as in it there are ways like he is as sad as the clouds there are two thing they are comparing it too and it has as but metaphor could have as or like in it but still wouldn't be a simile.

Most students don't take their career selections seriously until senior year or until they graduate highschool. Take advantage of classes in highschool because they are free and very helpful for the future. Commiting early on is key to being more successful in that career and for your journey to that career.\n\nSecondly, commiting to a career at a young age is useful to build up confidence in that student so they have the urge to want to pursue that career and be more serious about what they wanna do. Highschool offers many electives and academy classes that students should take advantage of to stay ahead of the game in what they wanna do as a career. Its a smart way and fun way to go deeper in the career you want and learn more from it and have it help you in the future. In addition this gives more time for preparation and being able to learn more about the career of your choice by selecting electives in highschool that are in that field of study of the career you wanna pursue. Students should commit to a career at a young age or specifically by the time they get to highschool. For example i wanna become an athletic trainer/fitness instructor and i am taking the fitness instructor class next year for my senior year to prepare and learn more about what i wanna do. While i would still go to college to expand my learning in althetic training having a part time job in doing what i love would be great. Another reason is that if you're confident in what you wanna do you'll be able to achieve your goal. They also offer a test at the end of the year to certify you as a fitness instructor so i am confident in taking that test and still expand my study at college because i believe and i really wanna have this as a career.\n\nLastly, If you commit to a career early enough you can start working as part time for that career for example, after highschool and if i pass the fitness instructor class and get certified as a fitness instructor i could apply for a part time job at a gym or something related to that and help others out to reach their goal. Most students know what they wanna do when they get to highschool so its a good idea to commit to a career that you are interested in and enjoy so you can start preparing for a job/career in that field of study.\n\nYes, students should commit to a career at young age mostly because always a good idea to start earlier than later. The earlier the better and more opportunitys would be opened to students.\n\nIn conclusion, students should commit to a career sometime in highschool just so they can start preparing and builidng up confidence in what they wanna do.

For example, back in 7th grade, I didn't really do my homework and I knew that I didn't make the right choice so the consequences were having a bad grade, and being grounded for a long amount of time. It helped me came along this far where I didn't need it anymore.

Group members have the opportunity to share their skills and collaborate their ideas, which can make the results of the project both more innovative and more efficient. \nWorking together on projects benefits everyone involved by enabling each group member to bring their own individual talent, perspective, and resources to the project.

Students have difficulties and they affront them without their parents' help. People around the world have thought about the way students should be teach or the way they should be treated but a few have notice that many students are struggling to build self-esteem. Because of his great achievements,\n\nApple is still one of the greatest companies ever created. As we know Steve Job achieve his dreams by hard work and not by the praise of the society or even his parents. In the other hand students that gets money from their parents, most of the time they do not finish high school and if they the do, they do it with the lowest grades ever.\n\nIn addition, praising student's deficient work undermines learning by lowering standards. Definitely, those kind of examples teach and stress the importance of building self-esteem by hard work. Praising them probably won't help them learn fast and smarter but it does not let them give up easily she wrote in a quote.\n\nHowever, students that are praise for their deficient work never improve. For that reason, many parents believe that deficient work lowers learning standards and that schools are getting worse and weaker every year.\n\nIn conclusion, self-esteem comes from the student's best effort, by working hard and not being unfair with the others. Although some people say praising student's deficient work helps build self-esteem because it bring hope for them, actually praising deficient work undermines learning by lowering standards because students will not improve their work and it is unfair for the hard working students.\n\nAccording a survey found in Google, many students quite school at a young age because they disbelieve how good they are at schooling. Furthermore, the survey display a chart where a big number of those who quite schools are the greatest students and according to the writer they do not have enough knowledge about it. Consequently many end up loosing their self in the worse way and they take paths that guides them into substances that had damage the rest of the society, like drugs or the alcohol. Clearly, praising students deficient work shows that schools are becoming worst more than in the past years and students now are not competent to apply for a simple job. Furthermore, parents lets teachers decide what to do with their child because they think schools will teach them the right way to learn about how life works and that includes self-esteem. Moreover, The New York Times post an article about students failure and they conclude that students that have a job and study at the same time, they are more likely to finish high school. For example Generic_Name, my friend's brother he quite schools since for years because he says that nothing he learns at school apply in personal life.\n\nEven though his teachers did everything they could to help him improve his grades, additionally they praise his worst work and it did not even work. According to the Generic_School, two of three students in a class graduate, but those who graduate are the ones that work hard and study for long hours to achieve their goals",
      "ai_text": "\nAs the pressure to succeed increases, the role of praise in educational settings has become more prominent. This provides evidence that praising student's deficient work can have a positive effect on their development. The study included 200 students from multiple high schools across the country and monitored their responses to praise and criticism. It follows then that providing appropriate praise which encourages and motivates students should be incorporated into educational curriculums.. The findings showed that students who were praised for work that was below expectations had better self-esteem, higher academic standards, and were more likely to graduate high school than those who received criticism. A recent study investigated how praising student's deficient work affects their self-esteem, learning standards, and their likelihood of graduating high school",

Sometimes, it may be best to be kind and forgive someone's misbehavior, while in other cases, it is better to be firm and demand respect for yourself and those around you. Rather than just standing by and being kind, in this situation, one might consider voicing their opinion in defense of the person being bullied and more actively standing up for them.

After this terrible day he find other opportunities to make a different life for his family. His life it was really hard before, they was not a family reach his five childreans only ate one time on some days. Forthermar, many people like to be leasy and they do not try to move on; Since, Other wants to move and work hard to make more opportunity. If you do all this your life is going to be easy for live. All the person who never stop work that person always make so many things\n\nFinally, be related everyday this is something special. For intance, one day I was thinking how to make my dream fast and how to get it. For intance, alots of people have not easy life some of they are not reach they do not have money to make more option. For intance, People can make many dreams so fast, also thing you never belived to get one day like a beautiful car, a big house, and other beutiful things. For example people who not try to move more far away they never is going to make something different, and that so sad because you never are going to know how many special dreams you can had, but that is going to happen if you don't move to the other side, but if you work hard and you always look for more you always are going to have everything in your life. Thomas Jefferson said. Struggle and you will have everything you want, exploit go outside and find others opportunities not lose you time the time run very fast everyday, you are going to cry one day may be because you was leasy and that is going to be sad for you, the last try to be related because there is the way you are going to find many option for make you life different.  . Is why everyday I think careful, if you wants something \"I need to struggle.\"\n\nMoreover, we can accomplish wonderful dreams, if we exploit the time. That means you not stop in one street you always are try to gross the other way.

In addition others people can give different life, because you have how to help othres. But, we has to know something that's true about this life that's nathing is going to be easy to make or do. For intance, you want a car and the car the cost is one million you will buy that car why, because you work hard and you have the money so you will have the money for buy this types of cars. Because you always are looking for something more than one. For intance, one day before granfather deid he tell my a story how they were before his life.

      "ai_text": "\n\nIn conclusion, it is undeniably true that individuals who have an active ambition to strive towards their goals will become more successful than those who do not, as stated by Thomas Jefferson. He did not simply wait for his goals to come to fruition; instead, he was actively involved in every step of the creation process, from in-depth market research to detailed product testing and design.\n\nIn contrast, there are those who fail to reach their dreams because they do not strive to actively pursue their goals. For example, many aspiring entrepreneurs will not risk their financial security in order to invest in their ideas, as they are not motivated to work towards their dreams. To illustrate this idea, we can consider the example of Steve Jobs: an ambitious man who sought to revolutionize the world of technology. To put it simply: having an active attitude of determination and ambition can truly bring success. \nThomas Jefferson once famously declared that \u201cnothing can stop the man with the right mental attitude from achieving his goal; nothing on earth can help the man with the wrong mental attitude\". His words have a powerful resonance in our present day, for it is clear that those who act on their dreams and goals can achieve far more than those who do not. Those who do not have a clear focus do not tend to be willing to make sacrifices or take risks to push themselves further. They will create tangible plans, allowing them to establish deadlines and strides in reaching their goals. Achieving one\u2019s ambitions does not come easy, and for those willing to work hard, the rewards can be great.. \n\nWhen examining individuals who actively strive to reach their ambitions, the key component is the clear focus on their objectives",

It is your differences that make you unique and special.\n\nWhen you are comfortable in your own skin, you will also be more likely to take on challenging tasks, explore new opportunities, and communicate your needs and wants with others in an effective way. There are no right or wrong answers in life, and you should not live your life according to anyone else's expectations. \nIn today's world, it's easy to forget the importance of simply being yourself. You are unique \u2013 no one else shares the same character traits, life experiences, and views as you. We are constantly bombarded with messages and information from society and the media telling us what we should and shouldn't do. You will also be more confident in your decisions, and have the courage to pursue your dreams.\n\nAt the end of the day, the most important thing is for you to stay true to yourself and do what makes you happy. \n\nBut it is important to remember that being true to yourself is essential for a happy and healthy life. As a result, many of us fall into the trap of trying to conform to expectations in order to fit in and be accepted.

This would make somethings easier for people like the people who dont like to come to school or the people who dont like to wake up early in the morning. This can also help the student's with computer skill while doing online school. It will make more people like school because you can take it online and you can finsh it at any hour but its due that day. Student's would probably have better grades because they would be finishing the work. Students would focus more because they have no one to talk to during the online classes. The student's can take brakes during this time so they dont tried of doing a lot of work. It would be easy the get help if the student's dont understand they can just search it up on the internet or ask someone in their house for some help. It will save a lot of time for the student's and teacher's because they wouldn't have to be there the whole day at school. A other reasons this is good is that student's that dont come to school a lot can stay at home while they can do the school work at home instead of go to school and not showing up. A other good reason is that the student's can show their mom or dad they did their work so they can do what ever they went after because most of time student's dont show their mom or dad that they have been doing work in school. . This way if student's are really sick and can't come to school and are going to be out of school for weeks then this will help the student's keep on track with the class. A other benefit is being at home everyday and not have to move around a lot. If the Student's take online classes then can finish anytime without have to worried about the class finishing and not hand in an incomplete assignment. Student's would get better information while doing this and it will come a long way in the future for them. Student's will benefit from take the school classes at home instead of going to the school because they could work at their own pace.

For students who are not fond of attending class in person, online classes provide the benefit of being able to learn from the comfort of their own homes. Students who take online classes can also work at their own pace, since they are not limited to prescribed class times. Taking classes online provides students with a convenient option to work with their own schedule and complete work in a more comfortable environment. Furthermore, classes are available on their own schedule and assignments can even be due after midnight, meaning snow days and other external factors that would otherwise cause school closure have no effect. \nTaking classes online offers students many advantages as opposed to attending physical classes in school",

Moreover, when students are receiving classes online at home, they will feel bored, and also lonely because they will not have anyone to discuss their questions or doubts with. . Also they will not feel the obligation to do their homework, in order to turn it in the following day. In addition, students will not take their courses with the grade of seriousness they have to be taken. Being in school is better rather than being at home alone just studying.\n\nLastly, attending classes online is not the best idea for students who tempt to not take their studies seriously. Also is not a recommended way to learn because students may not take their courses serious as they do in school because of the instructions of their teachers, or the advice of the counselors, or administrators of school.\n\nIn the first place attending classes from home is not the same has being is school, because at school students take their homework, quizzes and exams more serious that they can do at home. When students have to work in groups they learn lots of things from the teammates that they did not before, is a awesome way to inspire each other, and also to have fun, as students see other students work hard for their goals they do it too; but if these students are working alone they do the complete opposite. If attending classes from home becomes a common way to study, students will not have the opportunity to build strong friendships with the other students around them, nor with the teachers. As a matter of fact, student's grades will decay due to not having all their questions answered, and their problems being solved.\n\nSecondly, if attending classes online becomes a common way to study, students will not practice their communication skills by not building relationships with their classmates, not discussing their concerns with their classmates, nor just having fun with their friends during lunch ship. Is attending classes from home by way online of videoconferencing a favorable method for students to study?\n\nAttending to classes from home by way online or videoconferencing is not a highly recommended way to study, because students will not have the same learning that they have while they are at school. The students will not work on their communication skills, nor their social skills. They would not feel the same way because at school sometimes students get inspired by other students, they see other students not just as their classmates but also as their friends, they could even see each other as family, therefore, students with the time get to see the school as another home where they know they have people that could help them with school stuff, but also can give them personal advice, as counselors and teachers do. In addition, if students attend to classes online they will not have the opportunity to stay after school for extra help, or to retake a quiz or exam, nor to attend to a learning center to have other students helping them with their homework; or to just study with the company of another student. While they are at home they wont feel the presence of a teacher standing next to them telling them to get their work done, or asking them to pay attention, and to not fell asleep during class. In addition, in our present a large percent of teenagers are dealing with psychological problems such as; stress, anxiety, and depression; being at school distracts teens from their problems at home or even at their jobs, and it is a great way to receive help and advice from people willing to help them; such as school counselors, teachers, and friends. Therefore, this kind of students will think that they can do what they want and they wont take their courses in the serious way they have to be taken.\n\nIn conclusion, attending to classes online is not a favorable way for students to learn because they will not learn the same way that they do while in school",
      "ai_text": "However, it can also be argued that being in a school setting allows students to interact more directly with their peers and instructors, leading to a more effective way of learning. Ultimately, it is up to each student to decide what is best for them and how they can benefit from attending classes from home.. \n\nIn regards to the potential impact on a student's academic performance, attending classes from home with online videoconferencing has both pros and cons. \n\nOn one side, differences in the environment between attending classes from home versus attending classes in school can be observed. The question of whether attending classes from home is a favorable method of study can be seen from various perspectives. For example, attending classes from home allows students to have a more comfortable and relaxed setting which often comes with fewer distractions, leading to better focus and concentration. While attending classes from home can improve focus and provide students with the flexibility to work at their own pace, it cannot replicate the benefits associated with attending classes in person, such as human interaction and social development. While it provides students with the convenience and flexibility to work at their own pace with the right amount of personal direction from the instructor, it also creates a lack of human interaction and social skills that generally come with attending classes in person.\n\nOverall, there are many factors that contribute to a student's decision to attend classes from home via online videoconferencing. It is also important to consider the influence it can have on a student's social and communication skills as this is an essential part of their education. \nStudying from home via online videoconferencing is a topic that sparks much debate among students, parents, and educators",

It can also help you improve in your studies and make you a successful person in the future. Although this may be valid, but doing something always makes you great and achieve your future goals and helps you to be more responsible in the future because in the future it will be easy for you to get a job and mostly half of every job will ask whether you have an experience or you being qualified for the job. Everyone has a way to achieve or succeed in something they like. They say that because people want to achieve their goal by doing something, they often take pills that will make them stay awake especially for the high schoolers'. Making plans for the future helps you achieve or accomplish your goal.\n\nOn the other hand, many people often argue that staying idle to achieve your goal will make you less stressful. Many teachers and other colleagues will admire and respect you and you can even turn out to be their model. . Everywhere you go, everyone or at least someone makes a plan for their future reference or goal. And other people like to do something to accomplish their goal. Completing an action all the time will forever make you involve in important duties. You can get the college you have been always dreaming of and accomplish all your personal goals. It will make you useful in your workplace. If you want to graduate from high school and get to college with a scholarship, you will have to study hard to get to college. Thomas Jefferson wrote, \"Determine never to be idle....it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.\" I totally agree to Thomas Jefferson's statement that, we accomplish more if we are doing something.\n\nTo start with, doing something can help you plan, achieve, or complete your future goal quicker.\n\nFor example, When you are given a task to complete you can't sit there idle to wait for someone to help you or wait for a magic to happen to complete your goal. Planning and taking notes in class or anywhere else can make you tend to do something than to sit there idle to plan your future. This will make you be faster with every work you be given to complete.\n\nFurthermore, doing something always makes you more active. It also helps you discover more. Whenever I fail a text, even though I don't like to retake a text, I prepare for the next text we are going to have for the next unit and for all the rest unit we are going to learn. They say this because most high schoolers' wants to achieve more, graduate and get a better college and a great permanent job so they put all their might into studying and drinking and taking pills to stay awake and some student often get sick but can't stop cause they have been addicted to it. If you want to get a great permanent job, you still have to study hard and have a good resume. I like to learn ahead of the class because am not really smart to learn in class so instead I learn and prepare ahead in class. And you probably don't know what's going to happen in the future so you to be prepared and planned for the future.\n\nIn a nutshell, I like to plan my future goals and learn ahead of my class. For instance, when you fail an exam or possibly one or too many of them, you can't possibly say that you do not care about your score, you have to take action, study hard, and hope for the next exams you would make it to the top",

Also, spending too much time on digital devices can result in damage to relationships due to less face-to-face time with family and friends. For example, it can lead to an unhealthy sedentary lifestyle, as people often spend large amounts of time on the computer, instead of going outdoors and exercising. \nTechnology has changed the way we live our lives. Therefore, it is important to keep a balance between the two, in order to have a healthy and productive lifestyle.. It enables us to work more efficiently and communicate more easily; however, it can also lead to unhealthy habits and an overall decrease in motivation. In addition, even mundane tasks such as online banking, grocery shopping, and paying bills can be done quickly and efficiently without ever having to leave the house.\n\nUnfortunately, technology also has its downsides.

If you worry about what other people think you will probably be stressing trying to become something you aren't. People may agree or disagree everyone has there own opinion. The author Ralph waldo Emerson once wrote \" To be in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.\" Many people may agree with that, but there are also others who may disagree with his saying. Being yourself will most likely help you boost your confidence. My reason to agree with Ralph's quote is because people can see the real you when being yourself. Become yourself or do what make you feel comfortable. I think would agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson, one because you don't have to worry what others think of you. Sometimes pretending to be someone or something you aren't can stress you out because you feel pressured. Last but not least three, people can see the real you.\n\nRalph Waldo Emerson once wrote \" To be in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.\" I agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson because one, you don't have to worry what others think of you",
      "ai_text": "For example, deciding to pursue an unconventional career path despite the disapproval of family and friends, or exploring a side hustle despite the fear of failure all embody this quote\u2019s sentiment. In today\u2019s world, one is constantly bombarded with various pressures and expectations, such as achieving certain goals, getting into certain colleges, or succeeding in particular career paths. It is a difficult process, but a rewarding one, and it takes immense strength and courage to be able to resist the urge to conform.\n\nIn a way, Emerson\u2019s quote serves as a reminder that one should strive to be the best version of oneself and never lose sight of the unique individual qualities that make oneself special and entire. \nRalph Waldo Emerson\u2019s quote \u201cTo be in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment\u201d is truly meaningful and strikes a chord with many people. Although these expectations can be beneficial in pushing individuals to reach their goals, oftentimes, it can be immensely difficult to stand out and remain true to oneself amidst these pressures.\n\nFor those who take the initiative to forge their own path and not get trapped by feeling the need to be the same as everyone else, it is a great accomplishment. At the same time, it also serves as a source of celebration for anyone who has gone through their own valiant journey to stay true to themselves and their larger goals in the face of challenges.",

Students will find the answers then think they have a easy way out of online school by relying on Google answers. Personally I am a visual learner for every subject, I would need my teachers to give examples and to go over everything to me step by step to learn the material the teacher is teaching. not understanding the material and not being able to ask questions your last resort is to cheat for answer. Schools have dances, concerts and even field trips being home schooled you wouldn't be able to enjoy none of the fun activities the school would have planned for your classmates. Being home schooled you wouldn't have that \" high school experience \" everyone claims they love so much and would do anything to go back too. In school they might not have a class for communication but going to a Public schools does teach you how to speak up and communicate with other people you dont know and that would really be beneficial for the real world after school when you go into your career.\n\nOn the weekend I personally hate doing homework, I like to think of my home as a lazy environment for myself rather than another school place. I think if kids were to be home schooled they wouldn't be able to concentrate at home the whole time they are supposed to.

Schools offer different options of schooling, they have is Online School , Public School , Private School and also Video Conferencing . There would be no consequences for the student as if when they aren't paying attention or just on their phones the whole time. Students attending online school or homeschooling have a lot of ways to cheat for their classwork.\n\nI disagree that home school or online school would be beneficial for students because they wouldn't be able to learn and understand everything and to being able to ask questions, Students wouldn't have a social life outside of their home and not be prepared to communicate with people outside in the real world, Students would't have any motivation for their school work and start slacking off and lastly they can find easy ways to get out of their own work and having it done without them actually doing any work.           . Everyone isnt the same, Everyone has their own different techniques; Some people may be visual learners, They need someone to be speaking to them explaining step by step and some students just like peace and quite to figure it out on their own. There would be no teachers or administrators to be motivating the student to get to work, be on time or even get your'e grades up.

However, this decision carries many far-reaching implications that ultimately make such a move inadvisable.\n\nFirst and foremost, reducing teacher work hours would likely result in an increase in class sizes. This would lead to an overall decrease in the quality of education provided, as it becomes increasingly difficult for a teacher to manage a larger number of students. \nThe debate over reducing work hours for school teachers is one that has caused much contention in recent years. While it may provide teachers with greater leisure time, it is important to weigh the implications and maintain the respect and integrity due to the education system.. On the surface, it appears to be a reasonable notion; reducing the hours teachers spend in the classroom would limit their exposure to stress and provide more leisure time. This would detract from the crucial educational focuses of their role, and could lead to compromising standards as they would now be trying to manage more complex tasks in fewer work hours.\n\nLastly, reducing the amount of time teachers spend in the classroom could unintentionally devalue the profession as a whole. It would also add additional strain on teachers, who would be responsible for teaching more material to a larger class in reduced time frames.\n\nIn addition, fewer teacher work hours could lead to the primary instructors being asked to take on additional roles in the school, such as extracurricular activities and guidance support",

      "human_text": "I believe the majority will agree with this statement, but everyone does not agree, and talk about positive attitude. Famous entrepreneurs like Elon Musk would not be the Elon Musk that we know today if he did not had the positive attitude. There has to be a effort to find the right way, but having the negativity is going to close the door for opportunities. Positive attitude is the key to success.. When we take a look at the most famous entrepreneurs we see how a great environment they have, and how successful the people around them is, like they are. Fighting back with a positive attitude is also going to influence others to have a better view, so it does not just affect the individuals success, but others too. The term success has a different meaning for everyone, but still it is what everyone wants. The positive influence follows it self and creates a better habitat, and a better habitat will cause success.\n\nReaching to the best of the goal is impossible with out hard work. Trying to make the positive influence in your life with out positive attitude is impossible. It is the positive attitude that spreads the influence and makes a better habitat. People miss the importance of positive attitude which is the key for success.\n\nChances in life comes and goes that some might not even see. However, setting up a positive mind set is the part what individuals misses. Even in our daily life, when we start of our they in a negative way; the rest of the day follows that bad influence, and makes us miss the good parts of the day.\n\nHaving a negative environment affects the individuals the worst way possible, especially if the individual does not have a positive attitude to fight back. Every individual can have a different explanation for their goal, and the goal is the positive influence in their life. Loosing the sight while working hard causes to miss the train, but having positive attitude makes individuals seek for opportunities. If the goal is success, then missing the chance to making it come true must be avoided. When individuals miss the first chance they think there is no more chance and they loose the rest of there positivity. All of the hard work has no meaning if there is no pay back for this hard work. Elon Musk created a company named \"SpaceX\" for Space craft, and if he gave up on the first failure, and did not had the positive attitude, he would have never reached to his goal, and be successful. He created his own chance to success with positive attitude.\n\nIn conclusion, positive attitude has a big influence on success. No matter what the goal is, in order to approach that goal, and to be successful you need hard work. Positive attitude is what is going to bring the opportunities, and make the individuals create their own chances",

She used her positive attitude to help people with her own TV show, through her magazine and as founder of the Oprah Winfrey Network. \n\nIt is clear that having a positive attitude is essential for achieving success. It can also inspire those around us and can bring out the best in them.\n\nSuccessful people understand the importance of having a positive attitude and use it to their advantage. Our outlook on life can have a profound effect on the environment and opportunities around us. \n\nAnother example of a successful person with a positive attitude is entrepreneur Richard Branson. For example, Oprah Winfrey has famously said, \"The biggest adventure you can take is to live the life of your dreams.\" This positive way of thinking has been instrumental in Oprah's success. \nHaving a positive attitude is essential for achieving success in life.

When you accomplish something it makes you feel like you can do many more things leading to something bigger. For example, when you study for a test and you take the test the next day then later received an amazing score you challenge yourself to study every night before a test rather than take a risk and challenge yourself to study the same day as the test because you think you would remember it better.\n\nWe give ourselves goals we know we can achieve and play it safe rather than challenges because its easier. Elsa tried to challenge her self and try to use her powers but since it was so difficult she got overwhelmed and started hurting people\n\nIn conclusion, People prefer to set easy goals that they are able to achieve because it inspires you to continue to do multiple goals instead of one challenging one that you know is to hard. For instance, it can be the littlest things that you wouldnt realize such as, doing your bed in the morning is challenging but you know you can do it so you make your bed every morning.\n\nFurthermore, Setting easier goals that you know you are capable of achieving gives you an opportunity to continue to create more and more goals as time goes by.

People need to realize that its okay to have many goals instead of one big challenge goal that can make you lose interest in things . Do you challenge yourself often?

Setting both easy and hard goals can be beneficial, as it challenges us to continuously work towards personal growth and development. It is often difficult to accurately gauge our own abilities and comparing them with the goals that we set for ourselves. Setting easy goals can create a scaffolding that will help to eventually create a larger structure. \n\nOne famous quote by Michelangelo that relates to the challenge of setting goals in modern society is, \"The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark.\" This quote speaks to the difficulty of knowing our own limits when it comes to setting goals.

And the last reason having others people respect.\n\nWhen we create our own personality is means in a group of friend we are the funny, the serious, or the person the never pay attention what the other friend is saying ( that is me I never pay attention what my friends is seaying).

Have your own personality is important because that is what make you unique when don't permit the other people influeneces with idea.\n\nWhen a person is monotonous is they don't a different way to do the work they always is going to do the same every single thing for example in art class the teacher make a painting of a sundown and then they have to the same painting all the student is gonna put their own style to the same painting but this student is make a replica of the teacher work he don't put a different style or a different color.\n\nSome people may says that be differentof the other people is no important",

Trying to go to school and have a kid can be very stressful to the student.\n\nMy second reason I have for this statement is some students feel comfortable having class in there own safe environment where they feel comfortable and not anxious. It also gives them an oppotunity to sucsseed and graduate. Some students find it easier to do things online than in a classroom so its all about personal prefrence and i agree with this because it could be hard trying to understand what the teacher is saying or talking about. Parents would also agree that having ther child in a environment that they are comfortable in is the best way to keep there child focused and willing to pass there classes without any distractions that the child doesn't need.\n\nMy third reason i agree with this statement is students can feel more determined to do there work at home in a quiet place its very helpfull to the students needs to be sucssesful. Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? I agree with this statement i have three reasons why I think students should be able to attend classes from home. That can be very stressfull I feel like a student should comfortable in there learning environment because when they are comfortable they achieve better in there work. That's really hard for a student to do. It's good to have a sense of understanding when it comes to learning something that's very important for students.\n\nMy conclusion to this statement is that i agree and I think it is a great idea for schools to offer this to students because it gives students a chance to be at home and pass there classes with no distractions. I think doing online class works for a busy students schedule its all around is a good idea and I am happy that schools are letting students do online classes its a big benefit for them that's why I agree with this statement. I also agree about doing school online because some students find it easier and better than being in a classroom all day and not being able to understand the teacher. Some might have kids and they need to stay home to take care of there kid because nobody can babysit. There are some students that have anxiety and are not able to function in a classroom full of students that can be really hard for a person because its not easy trying to get your work done in a classroom full of students and dealing with anxiety. I also like this because you can do your class work where ever you are you dont have to be at home if you have somewhere to be you can take a laptop and do work. One reason is some students have a alot of responsibilities at home and sometimes students arent able to go to school. Some students get distracted easily and can't in a classroom so attending class at home helps the student concetrate and perform better with there work.\n\nAnother reason is parents would feel comfortable with there child being at home doing school work where they are safe and focused on the right things which is school work.

To begin with, it allows adults with responsibilities at home, such as childcare, to attend classes without having to leave their family.   In conclusion, there are a number of advantages for students attending classes from home. The lack of distractions, such as other students shuffling and talking, potentially gives them an advantage in completing the work with greater attention to detail.

A, (B) or higher is a good grade so that way they can play a sport they like.\n\nTeachers would probably accept this policy so that way their students will pay more attention.

In order to maximize the impact of available resources, many schools are turning to a potential new policy that would provide equal access for all students who wish to participate in sports programs, while recognizing that not all students are competitive athletes.\n\nFrom the student perspective, the new policy would be advantageous in that it could potentially provide more opportunities to develop communication and teamwork skills, while also teaching the value of healthy competition.

An nonparticipating students score will drop significantly. Most of all others think that students will actually cooperate to there fullest, and pass the class with higher letter grads. Most students are not fallowing a type of caree in art, and will not be of much use to us in the future. Really in fact art classes should be an elective instead of it having to be required. People arent going to tell use students what career paths to fallow we simply choose our own paths. A student that has the freedom to choose his or hers electives, he or she views the classes as more divers fun and interactive, then required art classes.\n\nFirst of all most people believes that all students are required to take art class, music, and drama class. Art classes are fun I my self take art by choose and enjoy ever single part of it.

Electives are much more divers, fun, and interactive. . In comparison students with a required class will most likely take the class seriously knowing if they dont tighten up, and do what is asked the'll get low grades on multiple assignments like projects, class projects, and event tests. There is no sense in making an art class a requiermnet for use students. Also students should have the freedom to choose his or her electives. However, at the end of the day art classes should be and always stay an elective. I also strongly believe that students should have freedom to choose which elective him or her want's to take. Like in an unrequited class most students will not actually take the art classes seriously, and fail with low letter grades. what sense is it to make an art class a requirement to pass?

Additionally, making art classes a requirement would limit students' ability to choose other highly educational pre-professional courses which can help them become prepared for the job market. Furthermore, making art classes a requirement would not be beneficial to students in the future due to a lack of freedom and educational depth in studying the subject. By taking electives, students have more freedom to indulge their passions and interests, increasing their enjoyment of the school experience. Furthermore, electives can offer valuable real-world insights, such as career counseling, which prepares them for their future.\n\nMaking art classes a requirement would deprive students of creative freedom, which often leads to higher engagement and enthusiasm for the subject.

I had to take music also, I was horrible playing the guitar and I was failing in that class. They would have to focus on the important things that they're good at. They won't have to stress about their grades to be below F if they don't take the electives. It's hard when some students can't do what others can do at drama or musics. It'll be easier for the students to learn more with their assignments, instead of worrying about arts or dram classes.\n\nFor example, during in my junior year, the school wanted me to take art and music. It'll be the best opportunity for the students to focus and work hard on their course classes. Some students may dislike to be in music or drama because they don't have experience to be singing or drawing. They should only worry about their course classes because those are the only classes that will make them graduate. It's better for them to finish their course classes and then at the end, they can take their electives.\n\nTherefore, these are the reasons why students shouldn't be required to take classes in arts, musics, or drama. They should focus on what they are good at for themselves.\n\nOne reason that students should take electives, they will pay attention to their classes and finish up their work to get the credit. Students shouldn't be wasting time on taking drama or music classes because they may not be interested in doing those classes. I never wanted to take art because I knew I would be awful at drawing and fail the class. Some students have no talent or experienced to do art or to be in musics classes. I just wanted to focus on my course classes, so that I can graduate and get pass all my classes to graduate my year.\n\nSecond reason that students shouldnt take it, they will finish with their course classes and will get to graduate their year. They should not worry about the electives because that can be done at the end of the year. I've told the teacher that I couldnt take art nor music because I wasn't great at it.                                                                                                                                 .

To begin, these classes often require special resources and materials which can be expensive for parents and schools alike. Instead, educators should offer advice on which classes to take as a supplement to other studies, in order to build a well-rounded education.. While many people believe that such classes can help to develop creativity, this development may be more easily obtained through activities and educational opportunities outside of the classroom",

Online school gives you a long time to finish all your work and maybe a little extra time to relax. People say online school is better than online school, but online school is more comfortable and nicer for students because they don't have to get dressed and ready just for school, they can take their time with the school work, and they have more time to do more stuff like get a job or play a sport.\n\nA lot of students get stressed in the morning because they don't know what to wear for school. We all get lazy at some point in life, and we just want somethinh that will make us feel comfortable while studying.\n\nAll students get rushed because they have too much work to do, and sometimes, they don't do it on time because it's too stressful for them to finish it all. How nice would it be if we didn't have to worry about any of these problems? Online school will have you relaxed most of the time.             . What if they didn't have to worry about that anymore? I don't like to get up just to dress and get ready for school. Online school, the type of school that students don't have to worry about what you wear or how people think of you because no one will ever see you. I rarely have time for school and work , but my friend, Generic_Name, does online school, and she has all time she needs to finish her school work, go to her job, and play lacrosse.\n\nSome might say that going to a normal school is the best way to study; however, online school is a better and safer for students because they are able to take their time with the school work. Maybe it's a sport or a job or it could be both. Online school is the best way to get time for all your work.\n\nEveryone that goes to a school knows how hard it is to keep up with the work and what they do outside of school. Imagine if you could do school from home and have time to relax or do more stuff. It would be great if we all had that extra time to do all that without stressing. they don't need to get up and stress themselves about what they should wear or how they look, and they have more time for other stuffthat aren't related to school like sports or jobs.

Along the same lines, students are not subject to the social pressure of their peers when attending online courses.\n\nOn the other hand, while online schooling can be more convenient, the workload stress can be detrimental to student success. \nOnline school offers several advantages when compared to traditional, in-person schooling. This is of course due to the virtual nature of the school setting. While traditional school allows for students to participate in events such as plays and team sports, these activities are often more sparsely available in the online realm. With traditional school, there is an instructor present to keep students on task, providing an overview of class work expectations. With online schooling, this structure is not always present, meaning it can be difficult for students to stay focused when they don't have the same level of guidance.\n\nFinally, one of the key drawbacks to online school is the lack of extracurricular activities",

I don't think working from home is a good idea for school students.\n\nThere are some kids that can't really work at school, but then they're others that just do it for fun. Learning at school is way more helpful then learning online you always have someone there to help. People are different some work better by themselves others work better in a group or with a partner that's is why working in school is the better idea.\n\nI'm not saying saying it wouldn't benefit the kids who are doing their work online i'm just saying working in school is easier. Some people are visual learners like right infront of you that's is why i think kids shouldn't work from their homes. Some kids don't have internet access so they wouldn't be to work online and when your at school you have all kinds of resources to help you.\n\nMy opinion in this is that working at school is better than working at home kids actually have a chance to get stuff done and at home kids would just sleep and not do their school work because well, they're at home. Even the classes online that you do if you work from home have people to help you if you have any questions or if you just need help. By saying how kids take advantage is because some of them would do their \"school work\" from home but it would end up with them just sleeping and doing their work later. I'm saying some students wouldn't benefit from working from home they would just sleep instead of work or they would just goof off instead of work. School may be difficult but that's why we have teacher to help you the staff and your parents they will always be there to help. I don't think it's a good idea to work from home they're a lot of kids that would just take advantage from working from home. You never know who your going to meet online.

      "human_text": "This world have many energy and resources, but we have to something to conserve all of them. We would still using the energy and resources at the same amount as we use to do it now, as we see is the same thing if we come to school the five days per eight hour. If we really want to conserve energy and resources we have to find something that is going to be successful, not something that would give us the same result. As we know some students miss a lot school on this day if school extend the day they might miss more day of school because they might say that is too long the day, or if they have a project to do and is a big project (we get out until 5:00PM), so we have to finish in whole night supposing we finish the project until 3:00AM, in the morning we not going to wake up because we are tired, we would miss the day of the school also we would not turn it in the project (It was the only day that we would have to turn it in), so we didn't get the grade for the project. They might have to paid extra money to someone can pick up their children. Some businesses have adopted a four-day work week, to try to conserve energy and resources, but they work ten hours each day that's mean that they still doing the same thing because they are working the same hours weekly. Somethings we have to do our personals things like help at home, or some other stuff that we need to do such as have fun with our family, or do what we like to do as play soccer, play video games, etc. This is going to one problem that I think must happen if this school extend the school day two hours more.\n\nWe might miss a lot day of school because somethings we have appointments as go to the Doctor, or go to somewhere else also do some important things. However, is going to be the same if we come the five days per eight hours because we would come ten hours per day, so ten per four is equal to forty hours for day (this is if we come four-day a week), so eight per five is equal to forty hours (this is if we come the five days per eight hours). Also teachers would have problem with their children for example if they have their children in a day care id they only work until 5:00PM they have to run to get they children, but if there is traffic, so they would be late. some students might decide to not come to school because they have to go the appointment. We have more time to do our homework, to do what we like to do like have fun, and spend time with our family when we come the five days per eight hours.          . My school should not follow this model because they have to think that consequences like people would miss a lot of school they might be tired too much work in one day of school to long one day, we would not have time to do our things at home like homework, personal things, and we would not have time to have fun by doing what we like to do as play soccer, or other stuff, and is going to be the same thing if we come to school the five days per eight hours. Even the teachers would not have time to plan what would be the assignment the next day, I know that they need time to plan in what we have to work on the next day, but they have to do things in their house as we the students too they also have homework to do after school. Also some students only would go home to sleep because like I say we would be tired to much work at school. Even when we come for the five-days per eight hours we have more time to do our thing that we have to do after school.\n\nSome people might say that they support to come to school to a four day school week and extend the day two hours because we would have three free days. We need something that help us to conserve energy and resources not something that would give the same amount the we are using now.\n\nFinally, I think this is not a good idea to conserve energy and resources because we would use the same amount that we're using right now. We would have to do all the things over the weekend, we might not spend time with our family because we would been doing homework, or some other stuff like personal things. I know that school is more important, but not the majority of the students thing like that. So I think this is not a good idea to conserve energy and resources, should my school follow this model by extending the school day two hours? I would say that my school should not follow this model because students would not have time to do things, students might miss a lot school, and is the same thing is like we come the five days to school.\n\nWe would not have time to our things because is going to be a long day two hours more, so we are going to be tired we might not want to do our homework",
      "ai_text": "Similarly, extending the school day by two hours could have a number of consequences. While the total amount of time spent remains the same, most energy-consuming activities such as heating and air-conditioning are required over a longer period when school is spread out over five days. It can also put a strain on resources such as electricity, water, and paper, reducing the school's ability to conserve energy and resources. \n\nDespite the potential advantages of a four-day working week, some organizations may be cautious about the trade-off between time and energy savings. \n\nWhen it comes to education, there is a clear difference between the energy and resources used when attending school five days per week for eight hours and four days per week for the same amount of time. By implementing a four-day work week, organizations are able to dramatically reduce their energy and resource consumption both directly and indirectly. Additionally, students must use more resources such as fuel to commute back and forth to school five days per week as opposed to four.

      "human_text": "But that's only what they have to face. It's better if know what you want to become early than late because it could waste your time if you start late instead of starting early or on time.\n\nLastly, having to learn different careers is good, but it'll some times be confusing, over whelming, stress, anxiety, and etc. For example having a head start, less stress involved, and lastly choosing you love since High School. He already has a job of what he wanted since High School but at the age of 19 and also told me he was thankful for staying with the career he always wanted and never gave up. People who don't know what careers they want, gives them a struggle because when you get to College or finish High School they would be in a position of not knowing what to do after. A year ago, I asked him about his career and plan. But people who know what career they want in High School will be ready for what college they should go to, what classes to take, after college they'll be applying to jobs, and lastly, doing something they always wanted to become or do since High School. For example, I have a friend who just turned 20, He always told me about what career he wanted to do and his plan after High School. Finally, these are the reasons why it is a good idea for students in High School to commit to a career at a young age. It's better to have a head start from everyone than being last.\n\nTherefore, knowing and commting to one career puts you on a very good spot. Is it good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age? For example, I got a academics scholarship into George Mason. Having to learn many careers is very good, because you know a lot and a high chance of getting many jobs. Trying to push yourself passing those limits, making yourself you can do it, never giving up, and reaching your goal. People would want to hire you because how fast and hard worker you are. Knowing and committing to a career puts you on a very a head spot in life and also on what you want to become.\n\nFirst off, having a head start of knowing what career you want in High School puts you on a spot that you're a head. For the people who don't know what they want to do, will start worrying about what they want to do, stressing over why they didn't think of a career in High School, over thinking, and etc. With that scholarship I earned and worked so hard I could have a high chance of becoming a banker or someone who runs money and I been committing to this career from 8th grade. He also told me, It wasn't easy to become what he wanted and no matter what if you want something, keep pushing and never give up because soon you'll be proud or yourself.\n\nSecondly, The stress of committing a career from High School is less than not having one. People who already know what they want to become or do will have their challenges because it wont be easy to getting up there. So what, are you going to commit to a career at a young age because time is clicking and soon it'll be too late. But learning and staying one career is better because you will know what to do in a mil of a second. But just knowing one career you'll be able to focus on that specific career. . The stress will build up, over thinking, anxiety, give up, depression, and lastly the most important going to the wrong path. For example, people who already know what they want will face tests, projects, public projects, quizzes, finals, and etc",
      "ai_text": "On the other hand, there is potential for added stress for young people who must adjust to the responsibilities associated with a chosen career earlier than their peers. On the plus side, committing to a career at a young age can give someone a head start on the competition by providing more time for them to gain experience in their chosen field. \nCommitting to a career at a young age comes with both benefits and challenges. It is important for young people considering a career choice to examine the pros and cons carefully before making a final decision.",

Starting young will help each individual student with, finding a job, how to determine if the job is right for you, and following along with accomplishing every goal. Although some may say \"Students should start thinking after they graduate high school because there's many jobs in life students might pick the wrong job\", but starting young helps the teens mind to find different careers. When did you decide to research your future job?\n\nStudents should start thinking of a certain career they would want to encounter by the time they reach high school. Also it's a good idea for young students to have at least a couple ideas of what they want to do as a career after high school. Research helps students find what they need as a teenager, for example: getting a Standard or Advanced diploma, going to College, and getting a degree. by the time students reach high school they must have a job they're interested in. Goals help by giving an idea to a student of what the second step is, to find the best career for them. Although some may say \"Information online may be false\" but there are multiple sites you can examine to observe the true facts.\n\nSecond reason, Goals help students with finding a career to start. These 3 steps will help students find the right job: Goal, Researching, and Acknowledging their goals. Goals can be both limited and unlimited. If students complete their goals, and research they can acknowledge their goal. After students have finished their steps students may continue on finding a job that they want from the data they collected. Examine the work they have finished and look through to check if they are missing anything. when students start encountering what they need to accomplish they will tend to work hard and start receiving the information they desire. . Also will have a distinct idea on how to succeed.\n\nFirst step, In most societies students start researching different jobs at a young age, so they know what they want to become in the future. Students will have a less stressful time finding the right job. Also by starting early with a goal, researching, and acknowledging goals they can find a job that they would like. Also research gives a better understanding for the student to know what to find. If students start viewing the concepts they need, they can become what they want to be. Finally acknowledging goals will help in examining job duties.\n\nIn conclusion students should start finding a job early",

This can lead to frustration and feelings of inadequacy, as students start to believe that they must achieve a certain grade average to \"deserve\" recognition and reward.\n\nAdditionally, a B average requirement serves as a disincentive for many students. Instead of giving them the opportunity to grow and learn, it simply sets an arbitrary benchmark that some may struggle to reach. Not only does it discourage participation, it can also discourage students from attempting to join in the first place. Education should be seen as the ultimate goal, and students need to be given the freedom to follow their passions and explore different options. Activities should be inclusive and easily accessible. It can actually help create an atmosphere of exclusion, wherein students do not feel like they have the same opportunities or privileges as those around them. Requiring a B average for students to participate in sports and activities is not only counterintuitive to this goal, but it can also have a detrimental effect on student morale and motivation. A no-grades policy is the best way to ensure this happens.. \n\nRather than having a B average policy, schools should focus on creating an environment where students are motivated to learn, grow, and develop their hobbies and interests",

Because they are wondering what college they going to and can they do well when they get in the college. So I would not taking the courses during the summer time.\n\nIn addition, lots of students are feeling nervous and scared in the last year of their high school time. A year before, I remember I have two elective class, and one of them was Korean. There are people swimming and surfing, people wear the sunglasses sat down there and have coconut on their hand. For example, if you take three years high school, then you can not take elective courses except you take the courses during the summer time. In addition, I think four years high school is more comfortable then three years high school.\n\nFirst of all,if you take the three years high school, then you can't take elective courses except if you take the courses during the summer time. Lastly, these are the reasons why I think traditional four years high school is better then three years high school.. For example, I was taking the traditional four years high school right now. Think about that sunshine, sky, golden sand, and beautiful seas. Because traditional four years high school is more better than three years high school. So when I laying down on the bed at the night, I was start thinking about college, can I make friends in college or what if the class that I take is going too fast then I don't understand what teachers are talking about. High school year is the most important year in students life. Also, I think three years high school don't have much time to let you get ready for college. Sitting at chair, face all these hard problem and finished it. In addition, summer is the time that people relax and have fun of. That's why I think elective classes was important.\n\nsecondly, take the courses during the summer time? Of course not. But at this time, you have to take courses at home or summer school. Some school programs allow students to graduate in three years,if you can choose, which one would you like to take? traditional or three years? For me, I would think of four years high school. In the summer everyone was plan go to the beach or traveling to another country with the family. Even know learning different language is hard, but it was very interesting, because you are learning about another countries' culture and how did they treat people in their ways. Even know I was senior right now, but that still happens to me, because college is totally different than high school, and I worry a lot about it. So I think four years high school would have more time to get ready for college.\n\nEven know some programs are allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years, but think about that, if you and your friends didn't go to the same college, then you will have to leave them early and you also have to leave your family one year early.\n\nFinally, I think traditional four years high school is more better then three years high school, and it makes you feel comfortable and have more time, instead squeeze the time together and make your self busy then others",
      "ai_text": "Students are able to explore content outside of their required courses, like music, theatre, and a variety of other electives, allowing them to expand their knowledge and foster meaningful relationships with their peers and teachers. Additionally, participating in extracurricular activities can also be difficult in three year programs, as students have less time to explore their interests. Furthermore, four year programs can provide students with more realistic expectations about the difficulty and expectations of college courses, which can help them better prepare for the demands of higher education.\n\nBy comparison, three year programs often focus on a more limited set of topics and can impose more pressure on students to excel in a narrow range of study. To begin, four year high school programs give students more time to explore a variety of different subjects and develop their academic interests. \n\nIn conclusion, traditional four year high school programs offer more opportunities for students to broaden their knowledge base and better understand the college experience ahead of them. \nTraditional four year high school programs have many valuable benefits compared to three year high school programs. While advancing through the educational pipeline quicker can save time and money, it may also leave students less prepared for college coursework. Though three year programs may offer economic advantages, their outcomes may be ill-suited to future success.",

But always remember never give up and keep pushing for your goal because not only in school will you be stressing. If the kids are active and are having fun they would get things done faster and easier like say a student was gonna pay sports and you tell him he has to finish they homework in order to play if the kid loves the sport he would do it. Lastly these are some of the reasons why I think it would be a good idea for our schools to have afterschool activities it will help a lot. the students also get bored of being in a quiet room just working on they work students like to be active not just sitting in one place bored.\n\nLast but not least you got to put effort in the work to be able to understand it and to get it done or if not you would be having a very rough time on your assighnment. A lot of kids give up in school and don't be wanting to do they homework thats why when soembody is doing activitties and learning they wouldn't give up on they selfs that easy on they selfs. Sometimes kids at home dont like to do they homework but if they do activities after school they would actually want to do the work so they can do the activitties.\n\nTo begin with kids get bored of just sitting there doing homework but if their actually doing activitties they would'nt be bored and actually work on they homework. The teachers can explain the work better for them so they can understand and learn it better.\n\nTo continue you must show them that the work is very important, and the kids would actualy take it seriously and they could actually improve there grade. It will help then get they work done faster, and also better for them to understand. nowadays kids like to do they work in activitties such as math games, card games, and many more.

For the electives the students would probably have to switch them out with core classes. To some teens going through with the program could be a difficult task. Another reason to why students want to finish is because they could have problems at their school. For highschool teens who do this program would have no time to slack off and would have to work had achieve their goal of finishing in three year.\n\nIn the three year program you are given choices on how you would like to do youre work. There are teens in high school that want to join the work force at a young age.\n\nThe three year program has a lot of good benefits for students, but its not an easy thing to do. This would mean students will have to take extra math, science, history, and english classes. Have you ever thought about finishing high school early? Not every student wants to finish school in four years. There are schools that could let you take the program through online",
      "ai_text": "Additionally, students who are looking to pursue specialized education pathways or training can benefit from the three-year program by entering college sooner and gaining that extra year of experience before entering the workforce. This can make college easier to manage by eliminating extra financial expenses and allowing students more time to focus on their studies. Also, the loss of the extra year of high school could make it harder to transition socially and might add an extra level of stress as students try to adapt to college life. \n\nOn the other hand, one of the biggest downsides to the three-year program is the potential limited exposure to different classes and other learning opportunities. While the program offers some advantages, there are also several potential drawbacks that must be considered. High school students might not have the time to develop the critical thinking and problem-solving skills needed in the college environment if they don\u2019t have access to a full range of classes. \nThe three-year high school program is an alternative to the traditional four-year cycle that can help students graduating early, save tuition costs, or enter college earlier. While it can help students get to college sooner and reduce the cost of tuition, the limited exposure to different classes and social aspects should be taken into account before making a decision.. \n\nOn the positive side, students can graduate high school one year sooner than if they had followed the tradition four-year program. \n\nThe three-year high school program has both advantages and disadvantages for students",

After two years of his graduation he found a job ,he bought a house and a car and that is all Generic_Name did for the rest of his life. If we never give up to do something beyond our spirit preserve young while we have more experience we'll have more opportunities nos just in a professional aspect . In my opinion,if we don't try to do something beyond what we have already mastered,we'll never grow because we'll never have the enough experience and a better quality of life.\n\nFirst,we'll never the enough experience because we always being in the same situation, every experience that we have make our knowledge,the way that we see the life and the problems. For example,when we continue learning more and more we'll stay one step more near of our challenge and we need continue to the same way.\n\nIn summarize,I'm agree with Emerson's statement because we always need to be more that we were yesterday. Should we aspire just at one thing? In every single aspect of our life we have aspiration, to be more every day to get the most beautiful house, the better job but that is all when we get all the we want and the set we stop there. For example,if we go to college and we finish the career but we stop there for the simple reason it is more safe so we never grow because that make us to be stagnate in one place,we think that doesn't matter that we good.\n\nSecond,We'll have a better quality of life because when we try to do the best every day,when we kept learning we became in a successful person which is good point because you inspire at others.

Without continual growth, it can become easy to become complacent with one\u2019s achievements and fail to recognize potential to strive for greater heights.\n\nOverall, continuing to grow and strive beyond what one has achieved is an important component for a successful life. Utilizing existing successes as motivation and fuel for success can propel one closer to their goals. By embracing growth and utilizing existing successes as motivation, one can push boundaries and challenge themselves. While some may argue that it is possible to maintain a status quo and have a fulfilling life, it is essential to continue growing and pushing the boundaries of our capabilities in a variety of ways.\n\nContinuing to grow and strive for more beyond what you have achieved can lead to positive outcomes, such as increased confidence in oneself and the ability to tackle increasingly difficult tasks. In the absence of ambition or goals, individuals may lack the direction necessary to lead a productive life. This mentality is often indicative of strong ambition and personal drive, as wanting to move forward and pursue more is seen as a positive attribute. Stagnancy, however, can lead to feelings of complacency and lack of meaningful direction. Additionally, growth can come in the form of experiences or knowledge, as gaining new perspectives and skills could lead to a more successful future.\n\nOn the other hand, stagnation and resistance to growth can be limiting. \nIn modern society, it has become a common mindset that one should continually grow and strive for more than what they currently have.

      "human_text": "Maybe that was the first break up and he/she actually wants to break up, are you going to let her/him to let you go just like that or are you going to ask him/her for a reason? Get on their shoes, sometimes things happen for a reason and if what ever your going through hits you in the back of the head is for a reaon, don't confuse yourself on accomplishing something and showing off.\n\nIn conclusion some things might be harder for you than others but you shouldn't end up backing up and telling yourself you can't do it, that it's too hard. Instead you should do the opposite and tell yourself that you are better than what you think you is and that your going to master lots of things with or without someone by your side telling you \"You can do it.\" This is my side of the statement I agree with and the way I look at things when I feel like I can't master big/small situtions. You have to learn how to handle the bigger situiton to know how to handle the smaller sitution when it comes to you. Don't let smaller things effect you at the end of the day the sun is still shinny brighter than ever, challange yourself so you can master and accomplish the situtions.\n\nTherefore if you can't accomplish something you've tried so much you shouldn't give up but also don't stress about it too much either.                         . People might think you can't handle what your going through, people will laugh at you for not being able to master something that is easy for them but harder for you, you can't just stop trying just because you feel like you can't no more. Although some say \"Unless you have try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.\" Based on my experiences I do agree to Emerson's statement because life isn't easy you have to try new things in life, you have to risk yourself to walk through that bigger path and try not to look back to something you couldn't accomplish back than, instead look up, stand striaght and tell yourself \"I know I can master new/harder things that are to come my way.\"\n\nSome say if \"You don't try to do something beyond what you have already mastered you will never grow.\" How are you suppose to grow if you haven't master something you can't accomplish? Life puts us in a sitution where not everything is going to be perfect, not everything is going to be rainbows and butterflies you have to challange youself, you have to show everyone that just cause you messed up once doesn't mean your going to make the same mistake again. If you think what your doing is the best than don't look back and keep doing what you've already started, life will be harder sometimes but it's up to you to show that you can master things you haven't been through. Try to master things so you grow not just kick things down the road and think that their going to come back to you. You have to go through the rain to get to the rainbow, you have to be prepared for the big situtions that are coming your way. Take a deep breath and I promise that at the end of the day you'll be happy because you master something you thoght you couldn't handle, but not only that you'll be happy because you didn't give up and you showed all these people that didn't beileve in you that you did it!\n\nOthers say that \"Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.\" I agree with this side of the argument because it's honestly the truth you have to master new things or you'll never see yourself growing, for an example if you just had an argument with your sigificate other and you break up with him/her your really just throwing things down the drain instead of sitting down to talk to that person to try to solve what went wrong",

All of these skills are important for leading a successful life.\n\nIn conclusion, attempting to do something beyond what you have already mastered can help you grow in ways that you may have never expected. This desire to take on something new can be a valuable tool to help us grow and develop.\n\nOne example of this is in the world of athletics. Taking on something that you may not have done before also helps you to gain confidence in your abilities, build trust in yourself, and even to become a better problem solver. Athletes are constantly looking to take their existing skills to the next level by adding a new one. By exposing yourself to something entirely new, you open yourself up to new opportunities and possibilities that wouldn't otherwise be available. It provides you with the opportunity to challenge yourself, gain new skills and experiences, and find success in whatever you pursue.. \nAs humans, we are always looking to grow and evolve into something better. They may choose to work on improving their speed or agility or even to try a different sport altogether. This process helps them become well-rounded athletes and ultimately to better themselves.\n\nIn the same way, people often look to improve their existing skills in order to find success in a job or career. We often find ourselves looking to do something beyond what we have already mastered or to learn a different skill. For example, someone starting out in an entry-level job may take a course, or even just read a book, to learn something new that will help them get ahead",

Each mistakes is a success more in our life, I think that failure it plays an important role in the persuit for the success.

For example, a construction project that is done on a deadline may not leave enough time for mistakes to be corrected, leading to costly and time-consuming delays.

For example, at work when I'm cooking I also need someone that can brings the ingredients. Which I disagree with for two reasons: People always need help and is more beneficial working in group. Some would argue that, working in group don't help you to learn, but we learn from others not from ourselves. In addition, benefits to us are made it from others, benefits to others are made it from us. I feel that the benefits come from others.\n\nThe first reason is that we as a human being, we need help. Some may say that working in group is not beneficial, working in a group we acquired more benefits than working alone. Additionally, we obtain benefits working in groups. We should always work in groups, helping each other as a human being.. To illustrate, when I'm sick, and I can't go to work I need someone to change his scheduled, and take my place, for that day, so he is going to need the same benefit from me to cover him one day he get be sick, or will have any emergency.

Working in a group also allows people to divide the workload, so each individual is responsible for a certain component or task. Discussions and brainstorming can help bring new and innovative ideas to the table and help everyone learn from each other. While working alone is beneficial in some cases, it is often more beneficial to have a group of people who are dedicated and motivated to work together towards a common goal. This helps create a supportive and encouraging environment, which can inspire individuals to continue working hard and reach their goals. For starters, when trying to tackle a complex problem or project, there is often more brain power within a group than an individual. Working in a group enables different individuals to come together and share their unique insights and perspectives, helping complete the task quickly and efficiently. \nWhen considering the benefits of working in a group versus working alone, it is clear that teamwork has certain advantages.

Everything in your life is in your control, and you are the only person that can change what ever you want to change in your life, it just depends on you, that you are going to handle the situation. As the boy grows up, and recognize that he should change the negative impression that he had at first, which kept him away from his friends or classmates. Changing the first impression is not impossible for those who have a strong trust on theirselves, and really want to change this, especially, if this impression is negative, because he knows or soon he will know that this can be very bad for him, and can keep him down in school, society, or in the place they live. Those who have negative impression can't reach their success, because having a negative impression is like a wall between you, and your success, that will prevent from you achieving your success. Most of the peoples want to change their first impression, because they haven't seen any positive result from it; they want to change it for a good future. First impression is like the first step toward your goals, so if you have a negative impression it will be almost impossible for you to get there, because having this impression can also effect your lessons, but if you have a positive impression it will be much easier to get there, because you can have more success in your lessons. Changing this show them that everything that they want to change in their life is up to them, however, it will not be easy to do that, but that doesn't mean that it is impossible. When we try to find new friends we always try to find about their impressions in our life; how can they help us to solve our problems, or how can they help us to achieve our goals. As, he knows that how much a negative impression will hurt them, they will try to change it. This kind of people will have a hard time to forgot their first impression. For example; if a boy in a place or society have a negative impression, other people who live in there will not let their children s to play with him, or to go to school together, or even their parents will try to change their children s classes if they know that they are in the same class, because they don't want their children to be like him, or to have a negative impression that he has. He will try to change it to positive impression, which will be hard and for him it will be a strange thing, because he never tried this before, but, as he continues he will realize that, how much he was bad with that negative impression, and how much he was hurt, by that negative impression. It well be hard, but not impossible. They will know that having a positive impression is not in everyone's luck, those who have a positive impression, on their society, school or etc will have a successful future. I'm disagree with this statement, that the first impression is impossible to change, because, I have seen a lot of people who doesn't had a positive impression at first, but later they completely changed. It is not going to be easy, but that doesn't mean that it will be impossible. It can bring a lot of changes on you it can change you future, your position in a place.\n\nI think that those who want to change their first impression should know that, this will not be easy, but if they try, and keep this in mind, that if they bring this change in their life they actually achieve a very big success. If a thing come to your life, and you know that, it will have a negative impression on your life try to keep them away, because they can make problems for, they can pretend you from having a good future, they will try to destroy you, so you are the only person who can keep all these things away. . First impression can also have a large effect in someone's life, if it is a positive impression it can lead to the success, they want to have, but having a negative impression will not only take away your success, but it will also keep you down in your society, you will not have the respect, that you want have in your society. Everything that you have control of them, and you want to change them, you can do so. For most of the peoples it will be hard to forgot about their first impression, because they have a good knowledge with that, and they think it is good even if it is a negative impression. Having a negative impression at first, and changing it will take much time, but changing this will help you to reach where you want, it will help you to achieve your goals, and it will help you to find a good friends, everyone will try to be your friend, and wants to have a good relationship with you, so you not only help yourself, but you will also help your friends to reach their success or to achieve their goals. They become to change themselves from what they were before, tried to forgot about the negative impressions they had before.\n\nif you Have a negative impression at first, and you want to change it, it will be hard, but it is not impossible, if you really want to change it. Having friends with positive impression in life will help you to take over your problems easily, but if you have friends with negative impressions, they can put their own negative impressions on you too, they will make think like a loser, because they don't want to reach your success.\n\nIn my idea those who want to change their first impression, first they have to think why they want to change it, what negative result they have seen with this impression, after they reached the position to change their first impression, they should start working for. In the process of changing this impression they will also learn a lot of new about how much will a positive impression good for them what can a positive impression do for them",

For example, if a student can't get to his school because he can't afford a way to get to their classes on time; Consequently, the student is probably going to fail his school year for not being able to get to his classes, this shows that having distance learning support is beneficial for students that struggle with this type of problems.\n\nStudents who have for a medical condition, will have problems to get to their schools because of their medical state.\n\nFor example, a teenager that suffer from osteoporosis is hardly going to be able to get to his educational institution, and this is not going only to affect the student in his education is also going to damage his life by not having that knowledge that he needs to be progress as a person in his life; Furthermore, having support of distance learning to student that can't arrive to schools is an important and necessary characteristic that every schools must have in their options, this demonstrates that having distance learning support can help student that suffer from a disease that makes them unable of being present in school.\n\nOne of the most important characteristic of having distance learning is that it can be useful in scenarios where the students are in danger of coming to the school for something like a pandemic that would make the schools close, losing a huge a amount of days that will have an impact on the school year; Similarly, to what is happening with the COVID-19 in several country's around the world that are getting infected by this disease and where they are closing the schools because of this virus, however with the use of temporary distance learning students would be able to keep on track of their studies even when a disease or something similar to this is happening at the moment.\n\nOn the other hand distance learning can be used in a wrong way, where students simply don't care about their classes, this shows that is not a perfect system that needs to be used only when is necessary to put on practice.\n\nIn conclusion the use of distance learning in schools is important and useful to the students when they have problems to get to their educational institution and that it also can be used in scenarios where the student won't be able to assist to the school.",

In addition, distance learning makes courses offered by different institutions available to anyone with access to the internet, opening up more learning possibilities.\n\nAt the same time, distance learning can be detrimental to some students. Distance learning has the potential to provide students with increased flexibility and autonomy over their learning, such as the ability to work at their own pace or attend to other commitments while still accessing course material. Furthermore, direct instructions and guidance from teachers can be severely limited in a distance learning environment, which can be problematic for those who require more support in their learning.\n\nOverall, the pros and cons of distance learning must be weighed carefully depending on each individual student's learning requirements and situation. \nDistance learning, or the utilization of technology-based tools as an alternative to traditional in-person instruction, has become an increasingly popular option in the educational context.

So yes i feel like our school should follow up with for day school week extending the school day two hours others students would not like it that way but teachers and studnets to but from my opinon yes i think our school should follow up with that .. Have Friday Saturday Sunday off go work on my 3 day weekend get sleep spend time with my family get my sleep and naps. It would help alot because i can go school do my two hours on Monday,Tuesday,Wedesnday, and Thursday and i feel like we could help out teachers alot not only studnets could help out staffs teachers and studnets . Reason i think it should is beacuse we can have a 3 day weekend, spend more time with family, get enough sleep,if studnts have after school jobs they can have good hours. Adopted a four-day work week with each conisting of ten hours should my school follow up with this modle.\n\nFrom my opion yes. It would help alot and be more easier for others and myself",
      "ai_text": "\n\nOverall, increasing the length of school days from five to four with each day being ten hours long is an idea that could bring advantages to students, such as having more free time and reducing their stress levels, but also has some downsides such as leading to burnout and reducing students\u2019 knowledge. Firstly, by packing the same amount of material into four days instead of five, students would have more time to dedicate to other areas. On the one hand, having four days at school could have many advantages. \n\nOn the other hand, having four days instead of five would present some cons as well. \nIn the modern world, where people are increasingly pressed for time and working long hours, the idea of a four-day work week with each day consisting of ten hours at school has become the subject of much debate. This could be used to get more sleep, take part in extra-curricular activities, or to spend time with family and friends. Secondly, it would allow students to reduce the amount of time they spend commuting, which could have a positive effect on their stress levels. It would mean that students would have a greater amount of material to cover in every class compared to a five-day week, by 20 percent in total. Additionally, it could lead to a greater focus on memorizing material over actually understanding it, further reducing students\u2019 knowledge. This could lead to burnout, as well as reduce the amount of time that students have to fully comprehend the material. It is important to carefully weigh both the pros and cons before making any decisions regarding this issue.",

Would you rather ask one person or multiple for advice\n\nI think that if you talk to more than one person for advice it will hep you more .One time i saw this quot by Lebron James that said if you need advice always ask more than one because one person could be right and the other could be not be right so dont be scared to ask more than one person there is noting wrong about asking the person you look up to. If i was to ask someone for advice i would go to a person that is very wise and makes smart choices so they can help me make a smart choice so i dont make the bad choices. And if you just dont trust anyone you can just go to your consular because your consular will never share your information with anyone and she will under stand you more because it could of happen to her as a child so one person can also be helpful.\n\nDont forget asking for advice can always be useful if its one person or it multiple people it can still help you but if it is a person that does bad things and you ask him for advice he can tell you to do the things he does and you will turn out just like him so do not do to someone for advice if they dont make good choice. If you need good advice make sure your going to the right person because you do not to be getting bad information if you have bad information you can make some bad choices.\n\nGetting advice from one person can also be good because what if your telling them personal thing they can keep it a secret but if you tell multiple people your personal information can get out there and can start getting bulled and you would not be able to trust anyone again so that is why sometimes you just have to tell one person if it is important information. advice can change pepole live if it is good.",

Maxwell: \u201cWhen I need to make a tough decision, I usually ask one wise person I trust.\u201d On the other hand, asking multiple people for advice can provide a variety of perspectives and insights.

This can be seen in the history of many of our most successful innovators. \n\nTherefore, we must embrace failure wholeheartedly and not be scared of the roadblocks that are put in our way. This anecdote illustrates how failure can sometimes be a necessary step to reach success. In addition to enthusiasm, the willingness to accept failure plays an equally important role in succeeding. Overcoming failure strengthens our resilience and provides opportunities to learn from our mistakes and improve. We must actively seek out opportunities, try new things, and create a culture of innovation and risk-taking. For example, Thomas Edison famously failed 1,000 times in his attempt to invent the lightbulb, but he persevered and eventually succeeded. With enthusiasm in our hearts and an open mind to failure, we will have the resources to succeed.",

They know what to do when it comes to the important matters in life. People that don't make their decisions on their own always depend on someone or something else, especially when they are very important. People should just follow their instincts, their gut feeling of what they want to do; they shouldn't listen to other peoples opinions. They think through about what decision they are going to make. The people should always try to make their own decisions instead of always relying on the guidance of experts and authorities.. People who value self-reliance are people that can make their own decisions. They aren't dependent on other people when it comes to most things in life and know what to do to get past certain things. People should make their own decisions based on what they want/need to do for their life.\n\nMaking your own decisions helps you grow mentally, every major decision you've made affects your life every day. Being Independent also goes in the same category as making your own decision. For Example: Buying your own house, getting married , and dropping out of school are all very important decisions that you and only you can make. You do everything by yourself when you are independent, all the decisions you've made has either had positives or negatives for your life, asking someone for their opinion is only going to make you more biased to that choice. They know making your own decisions is better than being guided towards what decision to make. These people grow a lot mentally because they end up knowing a lot because they go through with the decisions themselves; they don't listen to other people and don't make their decisions based on what other people say.\n\nSelf-Reliant people know how to get through their important or \"life changing\" decisions.

For example, when making a major life decision such as buying a house, getting married, or dropping out of school, individuals should rely on themselves rather than asking for help or advice from someone else, as it allows for greater personal growth and self-efficacy.

      "human_text": "There are some reasons to believe this is true: one, failure gives experience to do it better next time, two, failure makes one think about different possibilities to be prepare to control the situation, three, failure gives the option to try again.\n\nFirst, failure gives experience; this helps to learn how to dont make the same mistake. To who may concern.\n\nThe Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that \"success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm\", is well know that some people believe in this statement and some other don't. For example, take a test driver and fail but still studying to take it again; to get the necessary score to pass, this show that person decide to try again. Another example, learn a new language is difficult in various forms like the pronunciation or the form to make a sentence; failure give experience to improve abilities like these too.\n\nSecond, failure makes one think about different possibilities. For example, if one try to built a ship inside a bottle and fail because the little pieces of the ship broke inside for dont be careful, that persons if going to think about what can make the pieces break next time to avoid the same situation. Another example, when one try to learn how to do a magic trick, the first times fail is guarantee, but with perseverance one can be the best magician, this can be only reached if one decide to try again after fail.\n\nAlthough, one can learn from the failures, is not necessary fail to success, but sometimes one can't decide to don't fail; fail is a form to learn something from the mistakes, for example, fail to do something can make one know what is wrong and what is necessary to do to correct and prevent a future failure.\n\nIn conclusion, one dont need to fail to learn, but \"perseverance is the key for success\" and when one go from failure to failure without giving up; the action to dont give up show how capable is that person to success.. For example, to learn how to cook is a \"try and fail\" because one needs to put a specific amount of spices and vegetables is a long process to give the food a good flavor; failure said what are the mistakes one needs to correct like to dont put much sugar in the cake or dont put much salt in the salad. Another example, if one flew a kite and a bird or the wind make the kite crash, the next occasion \"what can make the kite crash?\" is going to be a possibility to think.\n\nThird, failure gives the option to try again",

Perseverance can be a great asset in this respect, as an individual who does not surrender to failure is more likely to find success in the end. It is furthermore possible that an individual may gain a sense of confidence which kernels from a long-term period of success, and will thus be less likely to fail or struggle in future endeavours.. \nThe late British Prime Minister Winston Churchill famously declared that \u201csuccess consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.\u201d This statement holds a great deal of truth in its meaning, as while failure is unavoidable, those who maintain enthusiasm when things don\u2019t go their way are able to remain positive and even learn from their mistakes",

For example if I were to leave shcool for 3-4 weeks I wouldn't want to come back to the same classes and with the same routine, It's just that Students do retain the information they teach they would have to go over it just so they get back on track. . because they if they did have a year- around teachers wouldn't have to worry about re-teahing it again to the students because they would expect them to already know what they are taking about. having go to go school for a couple of months straight across and then just have a couple of months off for summer. if they were to change the school routine it would just mess things up with the students and their grades and that would e more work of teachers. and im an sure that kids wouldn't like to have only 3-4 weeks off school after all the time they spend in school\n\nThis is why students should have a right amount of school and a certain amount of months off. But the fact of having year-around school isn't it just doesn't make a diffrence. when their break is over they would have to go back to school not only that but they would have to pick up from where the left off at first.

If they were to change the school routine to kids having to have breaks for 3-4 week's they wouldn't come back with the same effort as they do when they come back off of summer break.. a year-around school benifits teachers not students.

What if some important test is coming up for the students and they only have a certian amount of time to get things done within the time period and then they would leave on break what if the teacher couldnt get everything done in time then te whole class would fail the test.\n\nThis is why they should just leave school as it is just so that student's and teacher's wouldn't have to go throught all that trouble, Just get what they need to get done within the time they are their and then when they are done with all the work they needed to get done with they could leave for summer break, just so students dont stress over the facts that they have to get things done in a certain amout of time",

She gets angry when I try to stay in bed and not do anything, because I always need to be active to get somewhere in life.\n\nWe achieve more when we stay active, and we always are doing something good. My coach tells me the more I practice, and the busier that I am the better condition I will be in for the game. I am always doing something while I am in school, and I am not allowed to be on my cell phone. I want to be the best player that I can be, and to do this I have to always practice. This will not help me pass in school, even after school I sometimes stay in tutoring for Math and English, because I have trouble. Soccer takes a lot of energy and you are always active in the game and you need to be more active than the other team to win. I have to agree that always staying busy will allow you to accomplish more in life.\n\nIn my school, soccer also helps me stay busy, because I am on the team. My goals in life are to go to school, and graduate from a college, play sports to stay in condition, and make a better life for my kids like my mother.

Well for me i cant hangout with my friends because i have strict parents they wont let me get out of the house unless i have good also they don't let me hang out with friends so the only way i can see them is at school. 'If the school adds one hour and thirty minutes in a schools day'' honestly i dont agree nor disagree their some pros and con with this topic. Honestly for me everyday when i get home i take a nap if dont have that nap i will be mad all night so many other kid could be just like me when they dont get a nap they are really rude so that bad for them ant the teachers also you will see kids falling asleep and teacher will yell at them. Well the only way to fix this to give them snack yeah that could help but how your going get the snack you have to buy them with money they are going to tell the kids to buy the snacks and the schools wont buy it. So having more time in school is good and bad . Fourth pro is you can get to know your teacher and the students in the class you can learn many new thing about the teacher that you would never know about sometime its cool to hear their story because it could teach you something or can make you laugh. So i learn that their many good thing of having more time in a school day.\n\nThe cons of having one hour and thirty minutes in school day. Second If their were longer classes kids will lean more things and pay attention,if its their favorite class well it will be good for them because its longer. Another pro is if you have question on your homework the teacher can help you out by teaching you and you dont have to worry about the time because you have plenty of minutes to learn. Third con is classes will be harder because you have remember a lot of stuff for the test that your going to have that week. Second con is if the kid has doctor appointment they will go and the next day they will miss a lot of stuff in class and they make it up and the teacher wont teach it again because they have to move on and learn something new. First con is kids will be tired and they wont think that much or pay attention because all their energy is gone. The pros are that you learn more its good because schools get out earlier for the summer so their more summer days to enjoy. The kids will be rude and wont do anything because they are tired or hungry. So i learn that their many not so great things of having more time in school.\n\nIn the end they are many good like getting help for work and their may bad things like getting tired. For me I love music class if i have more time in that class i could learn more things about music and i could be better player.

Ultimately, it is important to carefully think through and weigh these different factors in order to make an informed and beneficial decision..

      "human_text": "This why you shouldn't listen to people making decisions for you this is because they can cause problem and get you in a situation where you dont want to be put in.\n\nIn life theirs so many things you can do but it all up to you . My third reasons why I would say that people should be able to make their own decisions is because you shouldnt follow what others do. You should always question yourself is it a good choose or not because your the one making your own chooses. Only you know what chooses you want to make. This is because everyone does what they want to do in life . People in life are not always right about things ,you dont want to get in trouble for doing something dumb or that isn't the right thing for you to do . Everyone is their self you shouldn't be controlled by anyone. You always see people making good or bad chooses or making not good decisions but does that mean you got to do what others do, no because you have to make those chooses on your own.\n\nMy decision for people to make their own decisions would be because trusting others on what they say isnt always the right things. People just need time to think about what chooses or decisions they want to make so that after they make the chooses or decisions they don't think about it twice and why they should've made a wisely decision. In that case that is not right because it makes them get in trouble and they lose time of education for making bad decision.\n\nWhen it comes to making your decisions you make your chooses. If you make a bad decision thats all on you because you made the decision not someone else you can't blame others for that when it comes to you getting involved in a situation that you got yourself put in.     . Another reason would be because only yourself know what chooses you want to make in life and so those are your decisions. Don't let yourself down or stress about what's rights for you in life. I know in the world we live in we all know that not everyone makes good chooses which is okay in some cases. If you do don't want to do something you should't do it . There are ton of students in school who make bad decisions and this because they like to do what others do by following what others do and seeing others do bad chooses. You decide what you want to do, you shouldn't let other people judge you in your decisions because they shouldnt get in involved . No one has the right to choose to do things for others when it comes to making chooses it all depends on yourself.\n\nIn conclusion just always remember that you should always pick your decisions and not others for you. Do you make your own decisions or do you seek guidance from experts ? I believe that people should be able make their own decisions. I know your children in school might've gotten in trouble with something and if not it because they are great children who don't follow what others do. I believe this because people are not away right about things and what they say. Would you want your best friend making a decisions for you ? Maybe not because you never know if she/he could be right or telling a lie. Don't be afraid to not do something because you think it a bad decisions just first before everything think about what your doing. If you make a good decision on something at school or basically anywhere you can show others on how to make good chooses so they wouldn't make mistakes . When it came to me making new friends at school I choose wisely with who I would want to be friends with because I didn't want me to be influenced by making bad chooses by others. This just means that not everyone is perfect which is true because their is at least one thing in life that you made a bad decision on",

By taking into account factors such as trust in others, judgment of others, avoiding bad influences, and questioning oneself before taking action, one can make more informed decisions that could lead to positive life changes.. Not doing so can have a negative impact on one's life, such as leading to financial or physical stress, which can cause even more difficulty in the long run. \n\nThe effects of making decisions on one's own can be far-reaching, leading to improved self-confidence, more self-reliance, and a sense of freedom. \n\nIn conclusion, making one's own decisions is an important part of life, and can be beneficial if done with consideration for all possible outcomes",

In addition, students may miss out on certain elective classes if they cannot find enough time in their course load. \n\nOn the positive side, finishing high school early allows students to save time and energy during a crucial period in their developmental years, allowing them to focus more directly on other pursuits. Students who are in a hurry to finish their courses may not give themselves time to fully digest the material, which can put them at a disadvantage when moving on to the next stage. Furthermore, those who enter the workforce at an earlier age may have more opportunities for professional development and career advancement, as they have a longer period of time to build their experiences and skills. While there are some potential advantages, such as taking advantage of college or career opportunities, there are also possible drawbacks, such as increased stress and lack of elective courses. \nCompleting high school in three instead of four years is certainly a tempting idea, as it shortens the amount of time that students spend in school if they wish to enter college or the professional workforce early. In addition, leaving high school early can give students an advantage for college acceptance, scholarships, and internships.

      "ai_text": "His refusal to let failure stand in his way highlights the importance of sustaining enthusiasm and resilience in the pursuit of success. \nIn 1940, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill famously declared, \"Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.\" This statement, a rallying cry for determination in the face of difficulty, has been held as an essential tenet of success. The importance of maintaining a positive attitude despite challenges cannot be understated; it has the potential to take a person from failure to success.. It is important to recognize the distinction between both approaches to success, and opt for the former whenever possible.\n\nThroughout history, many figures have illustrated the power of Churchill's words. \n\nConversely, going from failure to failure with a loss of enthusiasm can be extremely detrimental. The idea of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm has strong advantages - being resilient and passionate in the face of struggle can help an individual persist and ultimately achieve success. For example, inventor Thomas Edison famously failed thousands of times before discovering the first working incandescent lightbulb. African American Civil Rights leader Rosa Parks showed similar determination when she took a stand against segregation on a Montgomery bus in 1955. When faced with failure, a discouraged attitude can lead an individual to become apathetic, and even worse, to give up altogether. \n\nIn the face of failure and difficulty, it is paramount to draw motivation from the idea of perseverance and never giving up - Churchill's words embody this notion",

      "ai_text": "\nSummer break is an essential part of the academic calendar for many students and can offer a number of important benefits over having breaks throughout the year. Finally, summer break can be used to revise and strengthen understanding of difficult topics that had been encountered during the year, allowing students to return to school feeling more prepared and more successful in their studies. \n\nIn conclusion, having summer break as an extended break throughout the year is much more beneficial for students, both in terms of academic achievement and personal well-being.. Firstly, by having one break over a long period, students may be more likely to retain what they\u2019ve learned prior to their break, without detrimental effects from repeated long breaks throughout the year. Additionally, having an extended period away from school gives students a much needed mental health break and time to reconnect with family and friends. \n\nFurthermore, having all breaks in a concentrated period allows students to focus on other activities such as part-time jobs, or internships to develop life skills and can help alleviate any pressures that may arise if they are trying to manage part-time work throughout the year alongside school",

For example, these four years in high school helped me to find a passion about what I would like to become in the future, and also helped me to be more mature and feel ready for the next step.\n\nAlso, its too early for students to finish high school one year before, because students might be in the age between 15-17 years old and they may not be that ready to start a responsive life in college.

For instance, I've heard from some friends in college, that sometimes they really lost in some classes, even though they graduated from high school when they were 18 years old.

High school, its one of the best step of your life, where after you graduated from there, you would like to come back and stay more than four years..

Students can start doing something out of high school that helps them in the career they will choose in the future.

By not experiencing a full four years of high school, the student lacked the maturity level and knowledge needed to succeed in college academics. Additionally, early graduation can sometimes hinder self-development, as students may miss out on important milestones that could contribute to maturity level and development. \n\nFor example, one student left high school early in order to take a dual-enrollment course at a local college. \n\nOn the contrary, leaving high school one year earlier than traditional can be challenging. Without the full four-year curriculum, students may lack the exposure to higher level classes needed to perform well in college.

Hi my name is Generic_Name and I am going to talk about energy and resources. I know how it feel like to be in school for 8 hours, is it is not fun and it is really stress full. In my opinion if they are going to make people work for 10 hours for 4 days, they have to increase the minumim wage and pay a little bit more money.\n\nTheir is alot of reason why I do not agree with this new change. They would have 3 days off every week that in my opinon it would propably be friday saturday and sunday. Another positive reason I see for this change is, if you get payed every 2 weeks, and you worked\n\n4 days and, make 40 hours 1 week and 40 hours another week, it is going to be a good paycheck. It would sound kind of good since you get 3 days off every week, but at the same time no students want to be in school for 10 hours for 4 days a week ,that sounds stressing and hard .You would propably have more classes, a lot of home work ,and more test, and quizes. The only positive reason I see is getting 3 days off. This prompt made me put myself in that position and I did not like it if this would ever happen in real life I would be against it . I think it is not going to work because, people are barely working 8 hour shift and working 10 hour shifts.               . Those would be good reasons to work in a job like that. In my opinion I would not like that but I am pretty sure the school would like it because, they would be completing more work and they would be finishing lessons really quick and the students would study more.\n\nThere would be another advantage to that because the students would be in school for 10 hours for 4 days a week. The topic was really intresting it made me think a lot of what I was going to type in this prompt. It depends to if the people have time to work 10 hour shifts for 4 days.\n\nTheir are some school that want to have those same rules that some jobs have of 10 hours. The other part of the topic was what if school was 4 days and 10 hours. It would propably be hard for teachers to do 10 hour shift to because ,they would have to do more planings of lessons because they would propably have to teach lot of classes during the day since the school day is 10 hours.\n\nIn my opinion this prompt that I wrote today was really intresting. Now it depends how much you get payed but im pretty sure if you are going to do 10 hours shifts, they are atleast going to pay $12.00 an hour or they are going to pay you $11.00 dollars in hour. The topic was really intresting because it was about what I thought about jobs only working 4 days a week and 10 hour shifts. I think that the classes in highschool would be more longer the students would not concentrate .The reason they would not concentrate is because, you would be doing a lot of asighnments and, you would lose intrest in what they are teaching and, you would lose focus. It is going to be more painful for people, and they are going to get really tired. The reason why we are talking about energy and resourses is because ,some busineses have adopted a four day work week",

There wouldnt be so much negativity and so much hatred if somebody would just make a change.\n\nMy over all conclusion about this quote that Thomas Jefferson wrote is that it is important for people to actually do something and work hard and achieve there goal. When people witness a problem some people decide not to do anything and the issue will go away when maybe that's not the case in some situations.\n\nThere are people that are dedicated to what they want and will always do something to accomplish or achieve whatever it is they need to achieve and i think that is really good because it just shows that you are determined to do whatever you can to get what you want in life. I feel like what message Thomas Jefferson is trying to give is that life is always gonna be hard no matter what but you always have to push yourself and accomplish what needs to be done. When you put your all into something your hard work pays off and you finally accomplished something and that's all that matters. I feel like some people don't do anything to try to accomplish the set goals they have for themselves and they expect for that goal that they are waiting for to come to them instead of them working for that accomplishment. For example I feel like a lot of issues in this world could be solved if people would do something people wouldnt be running for there lives because there is a war going on in there country if somebody would do something about it.                  . It shouldnt be that way but some people think life is like that also when there is a major issue going on in the world some people think that doing nothing is okay.

Giving students the choice to select their own path of learning through one of these three classes allows them to discover which activities they most enjoy and in which their passions truly lie.\n\nFurthermore, studies have shown that incorporating the arts into education increases overall student engagement, as well as helps to foster a sense of community. Not only do they provide an outlet for creative expression, they can also serve as a platform for teaching invaluable life lessons. \nMusic, drama, and art classes are valuable tools in any student's educational journey",

Some students don't have an idea of what career they want to take when they enter high school. They don't have to have a hard time choosing one or changing the career for another one. For me photography would be the one for me as I like to take pictures of the most beautiful places in my home town. As students already know what they want to do and go straight to college. These students are taking a break to figure out what career to take, what college to go to, and save money to be able to go to college. The student will keep changing major until it finds the right for him/her. Most of the students are thinking which one will be good for them, and which suits them the best. By taking a break the student can think if he/she really likes the career they have chosen.\n\nFor all of these reasons I do think it Will be good for the students to take their time on choosing a career. In one way if the student does not like their major and think its too hard it will change major. This can help the students in many ways. Students taking their time for choosing careers is good for them and will help them choose the right career for them..

Family members and teachers expect students to know what career they want when they enter high school, so it can help them choose the classes they need. It is good for students to know what career they want, but it is also good for them to think it over or think it through. It can help them from not changing majors when they are in college. Students should look over the careers they want and see if it is right for them. i want people to see it not hear.\n\nSome students already know what career they want to take. For this reason it will be good for students to take their time and find out what they really want to take. She will have to learn how to do nails and learn the more, difficult, ways to do them as well. If they don't have an idea of what career they have a lot of time. I think students should have time to choose what they want to major in.\n\nOne reason I think students should have time to think what they want to major in is; they can get tired of the career they chose or change their mind of what career to take. i also want to the world to know what is going on fromw the different parts of the world and not the news. They have all of high school year to think about it before they entering college.\n\nAnother reason students should think about what they want to major in is, they don't know what career to take or they could have many options but can not chose one. In her Junior she decided she wanted to leave AFROTC to do something else, she wanted to do nails instead. Some students like to take a break and not go to college right after they leave high school. I have 1 year to think about which one. I would also like to see other parts of world, see beautiful people who live there, work with amazing people, and see what I can take a picture of. One career could be too difficult or one could be fun but not earn has much",

You can never stop growing omn something you want to master. The journy will be the important part becuase its going to be the part where you will be going to grow more. You will be able to master new things along the way on your journy to growing up more. The ending is the part where you have already mastered all the new things you wanted to master on your journy.

Taking the journey to master something not only provides the opportunity to explore areas of knowledge that were previously unknown, but also allows you to build upon existing skills. It takes time to fully master something, so requiring yourself to be consistent and disciplined in your approach is paramount. As you venture further, you will be exposed to different kinds of people and diverse views, which stretches your understanding and knowledge base. Every step of this process is an important lesson that teaches you the value of dedication, hard work, and resilience.\n\nWhen we make an effort to try something different, we can challenge our ability to expand our knowledge and to improve our skills. This ultimately strengthens your wisdom and creative approach to problem solving.\n\nLearning something new also teaches you the importance of continuity and consistency.

In every goal there is a purpose why that person is setting that goal, maybe it could be huge reason like impressing your family or following your idol and so on, but by setting your goals people often need to plan how they can achieve that goal. The goal can start from High school or middle school or somewhere were people have been brought out by their culture. He showed determination to the job and gave them a huge reason why the should keep him at the company. Determination is also one of the characteristics of positive attitude that leads people a success in life. Furthermore people accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows they are striving for excellence.\n\nSecondly, people accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows determination. For example, the movie I used in the first paragraph The Pursue of Happiness. I think the right thing to do is for people to accomplish more if they have set their mind on something extraordinary or even more enhance. So I had to take step by step or take my time to accomplish my goal. In everyone life has goal, there is no human being in this Earth who doesnt have a goal.

I had to take Aerospace, JROTC, physics, and this was kind of personal ,but I had to take PE/Fitness for a physic body structure, so that I wont be weak,fat or plumply when I join the Airforce.

He went to work even though he was homeless. People often shows determination, once they set their mind doing something they personally want to achieve or accomplish. Each person start from the bottom to get to the top, by starting from the bottom they can show higher authorities what they are capable off. People accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows they are striving for excellence, it shows determination, and it shows progress towards their goals.\n\nFirstly,people accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows they are striving for excellence. Do people accomplish more if they are always doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose?. The situation was they wanted to fire him to give him time to set his life or plan his life with his son, since he was homeless and they are living in the homeless shelter. Will smith even though he had a situation which he was homeless, he had job at the company and he was in a huge situation with the company. For example, in TC Williams High School my goal is to join the Airforce, but by doing that I needed to take specific subjects that can help me or give me the experience towards my goal. They authorities he worked with knew his situation, and they knew his dedication to his dedication to the company,so they decided to make him CEO of the company.

Through a variety of activities such as storytelling, music, art and science experiments children learn to be creative and to think outside the box. They also help to build fundamental values such as respect for all, honesty and responsibility. They offer a wealth of learning opportunities that help children and young adults to become good citizens of the world..

      "human_text": "Should school do the same thing by extending the school day and have four days of school? I believe that extending the school day and having four day of school could affect students by; getting them tired and they coud no longer in school.\n\nTo begin with, it has been said that students are tired in school because they have seven hours of school everyday . This could be an obstacle for this high school student and he will decided to not going to school anymore because he will feel a long day of school. As you can see,\n\nstudents could not have time to play and do their homework. As you can see, students could be absent in school if they extend the school day, and this could be a big probem for the community and for the country.\n\nYet some people argue that extending the school day and having four day of school, could make the students more intelligent. It is tue that giving extended time to students and give them only four days of school, could make them smarter. Imagine having less day of school, students would be happy and could make their education simple. Some films have alredy adopted a four day work week, but they will work ten hours a day. Students needs time with friends and family. But they will not longer like school because they will feel tired and they will not going to school anymore. After school the student will got home tired, he will jus eat dinner and go sleep. in conclusion, students are not slaves, they need time to play and do their homework.\n\nIn addition, extending the school day for students and have four days of school for them, this could make them not going to school. Imagine giving them nine hours of school, they could get tired quick and have stress. . Another example, imagine a high school student have to finish school at 5:00pm knowing kids nowadays they don't like school that much. To illustrate, a student woke up at 6:30am to prepare to go to school, he will start the school at 8:00am and he will be finish at 5:00pm. And this could be a huge problem for students and schools\n\nIn conclusion, schools should not allow to have four days of school and extending two hours more because this could affect students by; getting them tired and they could not longer in school. Let's make students feel comfortable in school, but not make them feel slaves. If school extend the school day, students could be just tired all the time",
      "ai_text": "On the one hand, four days of school can be fewer school days in a week and may allow students to feel less overwhelmed with work and have more free time to do what they love. \nExtending the school day can be both a blessing and a curse for students. Some educators and parents have posited that students could experience a \u201cwork smarter, not harder\u201d approach with four days to spread their work out over the extended school day, promote student-driven learning, and potentially have classes that are more engaging. Having four days of school instead of five may result in more hours of scarce study time, more challenging teacher expectations, and more cumulative material to cover. It is essential that a thorough analysis of these potential changes to the educational system be done to foster an environment that is conducive to long-term student success.. Additionally, there may be a potential financial burden that may come with the extended school days, such as the need to hire more staff and administration and the potential for less hands-on learning if resources are cut. It could also result in less time overall that children spend on screens or electronic devices throughout the week, as they will have more days free to explore and engage in activities with friends and family. \n\nDespite the potential drawbacks, there are potential benefits from having four days of school. \n\nOn the other hand, the extended school days might put an overwhelming amount of pressure on students. With the extended school day, students may be able to engage in more in-depth learning, be able to learn at a faster pace, and have more individualized attention in classes as the school day is more spread out. This could lead to excessive stress on students, longer days of being in a focused state, and ultimately exhaustion. \n\nIn conclusion, the pros and cons of extending the school day and having four days a week are complex and varied",

      "human_text": "But one day my grandma talked to him. There are people that think that can not do it, but they are wrong because if you propose something to yourself you have to work on it, you have to be a positive person if you want to persevere. In my opinion, I believe that people have to try to make something else to accomplish their goals because people don't trust themself, people don't take second chance, doesn't matter the time.\n\nTo begin with, most of people do not trust themself. For example, my older brother never trust in himself, he always says what about if I do this and it no gonna work, he was negative, he always had negative thoughts, he never tries make something else to get on top of his goals or what he wants. My grandmother always says ''If you want to accomplish your goals you have to try different ways to get in the top of your objective.'' Back in my country Bolivia the mayority of old people said that you have to be resourceful if you want to get what you want. I am agree with this statement. You most have to trust in yourself. The point is that you have to keep going and try your best to get your goals. There are people that does't care how many time they try something, to get in their goals. The just think that they want to accomplish their dreams. The 60% of people when they have something done, they don't like the result so they don't want to do it again because they did ones so they don't want to do it twice, they think that they gonna get the same result. I think people don't believe in themself, don't try twice, and people don't think about the time.. Manyh people may think why people should try twice, but that's not the point. For instance, in my situation, I used to ignore the secod chance because I thought that if I did one time and it wasn't that great so is gonna be the same the second time, but I was wrong.

True , I agrees that five heads think better than one , but how about not every menber in the group is agree with the topic or the material that they are working on; what could happen there is problems between themselves because none of them have the same goals or thoughts. But many famous people has shared their own stories of life and it show how working alone can open your brain to another level and acomplish more of what others think that just can be done in group.

If they can continuing to study in the future they can earn to much money, because in the past it was hard for them, but now is more easily then the first time when they start                             .

That's is the first thing we can do before beat the team, because that make they strong. We need to help them because sometimes we have a dream, but no body try to help that's why students can't realized they dreams. That's why we failure the game, because we work at night and then we are going to school all day.

It's always necessary for your teenager to stop by, and speak to his/her counselor once in a while to check up on his/her grades, and how she's doing overall.\n\nThe counselor will provide him/her the best information needed to achieve the teenagers goal.\n\nWhen providing options to a young age teenager, it's best that you make it seem less work as possible. It is vital that they should have some experience or knowledge upon what career they want to obtain, and become successful in.\n\nHigh school provides plenty of options for young adults, espesically programs and clubs that they could attend. It may also not be the career path they choose since it differs as they grow. It's always best to talk to your parents for advice, or to speak with your teachers. Teenagers most likely wouldn't like the sound of work, and would much rather hear about electronics, or the new clothing line at hot topic. These activities will satisfy the teenager, and It'll be the introduction to their future career path. Being freshly exposed to a career at a young age benefits the teenager for future desires.

The parents may sign their child up for activities they think would be identical to their career choice. Every young adult would prefer some entertainment with a little bit of knowledge, and facts being thrown at them. Teenagers play an important role in today's generation. Choosing a career may include lots of pressure and thinking. It'll give the teenager some time to think about what careers he/she wants to get into, and how she/he is going to do it.\n\nWhen there is a young aged teenager, it's best that they gather information slowly, and step-by-step.

These programs will help many students save time. Because of this, a lot of people, especially students are thinking how to spend time helpful. To enter college or the work, all we need are knowledge or skill, not how long we took them. Some school districts offer programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. They can save one year in school, that also means they can reach success early one year. They also take these courses after college or work if they want. Many people spend summer having vacations to relax, and evenings watching TV, but the other people spend this time studying. It depends on your choice.\n\nOn the other hand, many students do not agree this plan. The life is being more modern, people also need to improve themselves. Many students like these courses, but some students don't.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                . They can become stronger, independent by working on own and have more information about lessons because this time is not enough for teachers can teach everything, they must research more.\n\nThe last reason refers to elective courses. That's why some schools want to offer some programs which are good for students. Is it a good idea? It is. They think it gives stressful for them, they worry about they cannot have enough lessons. After all, which one do you agree with? It is a challenge but many students can do. These programs do not require to take elective courses, so some students can skip these course which they don't like or do not helpful for their career. They can choose also consider what is they need.

Most students who follow this plan will have a lot of experiences also challenges because they must have the same knowledge in shorter time than, they will have pressure, but it will grow up ourselves. Most students who allow this plan must take courses during the summers or in the evenings or may not be able to take elective courses.\n\nThis plan has two positions,some people agree, but others don't think it's a good idea. Sometimes, the life needs challenges to grow up and it will be interesting",
      "ai_text": "Time-wise, graduating a year early could give students more breathing space to explore their interests or reach life goals more quickly.\n\nHowever, some may worry that a three-year program may be too fast-paced; student learning and development may not be given enough attention. Additionally, if the program is not well-planned, students may find themselves missing key topics or skills. \nSupporters of allowing high school students to complete their studies in three years instead of four may argue that it saves students money, time, and gives them an extra year to pursue higher education, start a career, or travel. Furthermore, if students are required to take certain classes and tests to graduate, these may be a challenge to complete in a shorter timeframe.. From a financial standpoint, three years of high school fees instead of four could be a substantial saving for many families, yielding benefits both during and after education",

Our snap judgement of something or someone can impact us for the long haul, and this is especially true when it comes to forming lasting impressions of people. \nFirst impressions are incredibly important, and our initial encounters with people, ideas, and experiences will often set the tone for our future relationships. If that first meeting goes well, chances are you will have a good attitude about this person and feel respected and welcomed. When we realize that our instinctive knee-jerk reactions and gut feelings about people and situations should be taken seriously, we realize how much of an impact they can have on our lives. By doing so, we can ensure that our relationships with people, and our outlook on life, remain healthy and upbeat.. However, if your first meeting with the principal is unpleasant, you are likely to treat them with distrust and antipathy, and it could color the way you view them for a long time. It is essential to pay close attention to these initial reactions and work to make sure that they are as positive as possible. \n\nFrom these examples, it is clear that our first impressions can be incredibly powerful and can have a long lasting impact on our lives. \n\nAdditionally, our first impressions can determine how we look at the world. This can help to shape the way you feel about the world and can impact the way you interact with the people you meet from then on. On the other hand, if the party is less than hospitable, that can lead you to believe in a more hostile view of the world. \n\nFor instance, let\u2019s suppose that you are starting at a new school and you have your first encounter with the principal.

Imagine being at the DMV everyone given you stares, and your family telling you ''you're not gonna pass\".                                  .

One of them said you have to smile and say hey, do you need help with anything? and you said you continue doing whatever your doing. You work really hard to make immagination becomes reality. But knowledge is still really important. That's what a lot of people do. For example, you want to start a company, but the people around you said that your not going to success. Then I started immagining to help and more stuff. If you don't learn anything at school when you are older to get a job, your not going to get the job you want, because wherever you are there will be someone that want the same job as you but trying harder than you, learning harder than you, and showing more effort than you. Then nothing happened to your company. Which means effort creates achivements. Then you go to school to get your knowledge increase every year. I told myself you have to be good at science, math and other subject to become a docter. The people who failure in life are the people who quit something one step away from success. For example, you went to an interview for a job at a store to be a cashier and there are 15 people that want to be cashier. But if you stop asking people when no one wanted to invest your company your company would of been closed. When your in school your not going to try your best and show effort.    . So I will have knowledge about things that you have to know to become docter. Who do you think there going to pick? Of course the first one right? because she showed them effort and willing to do the job. Do you think immagination is more important than knowledge? Why do you think it's important? Let's see why I think it's important! Well think about this you have the knowledge, but you never immagine things that you think you can't do. Although they said that you started a company anyways. When I was little I wanted to become a docter when I grow up. so you have to get a lot of knowledge to achive the things you immagine.\n\nSo I think immagination is more important than knowledge. I feel like everything starts with immagination first. When I go to school. So first they asked everyone what do you do when the costumer comes in. So you have to immagine thing and use your knowledge to achive them.\n\nThird reason is you have to immagine things as your dream and get a lot of knowledge by learning at school. That why you have to immagine what you want to do in future and try your best in school.\n\nSecond reason is that you have your knowledge, but if you don't immagine or think bigger your not going achive big things in your life. You kept asking people to invest your company. But they only need one. One day you will achive your goal or dream.\n\nOne of the reason why I think immagination is importantant is that if you don't immagine what you want to do in future as your job or hobby. But the people who successed in life are the people who took the step that a lot people quit which the hardest step to take. So one person did, with that money you payed the bill. After a month no one wanted to invest you company",

He used this knowledge and his vision to create Amazon, which is now one of the largest companies in the world. His imaginative and entrepreneurial spirit has allowed him to build an empire and achieve incredible success.\n\nIn conclusion, achieving success requires effort, imagination and knowledge. \nHaving a good imagination is vital for success in both life and work. \n\nOne example of how imagination and knowledge led to success is the story of Amazon Founder Jeff Bezos. Additionally, imagination helps us to identify, understand, and solve complex problems. In particular, having knowledge related to the job we are applying for is important. Having a good understanding of what is required to reach our goals can be beneficial. Jeff used his knowledge of the internet and his imagination to envision what the online shopping experience could be like. In this case, their lack of knowledge was their downfall and they failed to achieve success even though they were so close to success. For example, if an individual is looking for a job in the tech industry, they should have a good knowledge of the industry, the role, and possible companies they could work for.\n\nQuitting just one step away from success can be a difficult concept to understand. But, the importance of having both an imagination and knowledge of the goal is key in these situations. Therefore, having a strong imagination can help us when we are trying to achieve our goals.\n\nAchieving our goals often requires a great deal of effort and dedication.

There are many students that go to college and they have not already decided what career should be better for them, and in many cases there are students that are out of college and still thinking what to do with their life. If the students identify a career by that time, in college they can only focus in the career they chose.

Such preparation might involve taking relevant classes or courses, engaging in internships, participating in job shadowing experiences, or joining extracurricular activities in their desired career field. For example, the more narrow timeframe could cause them to feel overwhelmed and less likely to take the steps mentioned above to adequately prepare. These can range from lack of knowledge about possibilities, fear of making the wrong decision, or simply feeling unready to commit to one career option. This could have serious negative implications for the student's future, as a lack of preparation may lead to less desirable college and job choices.\n\nThere are also various reasons why some students put off deciding on a career. This early start could give students an edge when it comes to getting accepted into college and/or the job of their choice after graduation.

Try finding a better and faster way to solve what you already mastered. Also try something more harder than the previous thing you did. Even today Lebron James is training to be come the best NBA player ever and works really hard to beat/break other famous NBA players records. Each NBA superstars have different stories to tell on how they got there. For example Lebron James, he wasn't rich or wealth when he was little, he had to work hard to get where he is now. .These are the reasons and examples on why I do agree with Raplh Waldo statement..

Furthermore, students can use the break to engage in activities which supplement their education, such as volunteering, attending summer camps, or taking classes that their school doesn't offer. Studies have shown, however, that the impact of the summer vacation on student achievement is modest and that, overall, the positive effects of having a break outweigh the negatives..

It is okay to look over the person you will meet because that way you are feeling sure with yourself about what this person can do or say about you.\n\nYour personality is something that can define you as a human. If you want that people talk good about your personality when you meet them, you will have to give good impressions by doing things like saying hi when you arrive to some place, talk about the good things you have done, sports you play or any healthy activities you can achieve.\n\nIf you are a socialist person you know people will look at your personality when you meet them because they want to know if you are a pleasing person, the minds can change, imporessions never do, even if you know a person for a long period of time, you will never forgot how they was before you meet them for the simple fact that the first time is something that almost nobody can forget.\n\nAnother reason or example can be when you are looking for a job, you can give good impresions to your probably next boss and the people you will be working with, not just by how you acting it can be by how you are dressing too, your underwear many times can show much about you.",

Some situations call for more formal attire, like job interviews, which create an air of professionalism, while more casual settings may call for an outfit that can still be maintained to look neat while being comfortable. Listening, being attentive, and having an energetic presence in conversations can show that we are putting forth effort to make an impact. Being friendly, engaging, and having humility with a touch of assertiveness is often the best way to make a good first impression. \nMaking a good first impression is a key element of life, and is often what determines our success in various aspects, from making friends and maintaining relationships, to performing well in job interviews or school presentations. For example, a job interview would not be the best place to dress too casually as this could give the impression that you do not take the situation seriously. Taking the time to make sure that our first impression is positive and memorable can pay off in the long run.. Being polite, and having good manners can be beneficial, as well as showing gratitude and appreciation for any help or guidance received. \n\nBy being conscious of our personality, actions and clothing, we can make a good first impression in a number of scenarios. Our personality, actions and even the way we dress can all directly affect another person's view of us, and first impressions can be incredibly durable. \n\nFirstly, our personality can make someone feel comfortable and at ease or it can cause them to feel uneasy and intimidated. Paying attention to personal hygiene should also not be overlooked. This can open up doors for us, both in terms of personal relationships and job opportunities. Good first impressions can also help us build trust with our peers or colleagues, which can have a positive effect within a team environment",

Students may not want to go to school and can find it very overwhelming but at the same time the students are working very hard so they can have the best possible life they can. . There are definitely many pros to having a good education and to be able to live a good life. School is a place where you go to learn, have fun, and the school has provided the time so that students can learn what they want by having electives that they like the best because that what they might want to be when they grow up because if the school didn't have such excellent teachers the students could never succeed on their own and that's why the teachers have to relate to the student so they can have a much better understanding so that they can proceed to adulthood where their decisions can affect them badly",

Colleges with large mass of land may not have enough parking space for students and we also believe that, not every student own a car or any type of moving vehicle where by one needs to park. Most students have daily jobs to help them afford to pay the bills, based on their level of education. Financial issues has become one of the problem in this generation of mankind, whereby students either have to pay to live on campus or out of campus to further their education,which has caused a lot of students out of school dorms because, they struggle to pay for them. Taking classes online or video conferencing is one of the best way to help students,who can not afford to go to college and for older people that couldn't get the chance to further their education because of their financial state.

This benefitted me get motivated for what I should do more and always helping me understand that if I put in my time and energy then there won't be a problem on feeling accomplished. Doing something remotely even small can benefit anyone's day in comparsion in doing nothing. I agree that many different factors can influence decision making but also making others understand how important you are to someone as well.\n\nIn conclusion, the more work you put in ;the more you are in feeling accomplished and in pleasing yourself as well. This helped me gain self-satification for myself and let me understand the importance of showing kids at a young age how to be accomplished when you put the energy and time too. Another example I ever felt when doing somethingis when I play lacrosse , and how everytime I don't make my mile time I strive to do better for myself. Working for what you need to do is different for working for what you want to do and this helps you understand the need for self -satisfication and social-satisfication. I would certainly always feel accomplished when doing something that can help let others know I care and not just for my own image. While, going to school and getting an education is a major rule in a human life; it is not for everyone and it all depends on how much effort you put in and if you are willing to put in the effort as well. In many different countries and cities, not all jobs require an education all you have to do is have experience in a certain area or part that makes you want to learn more. Doing something you love and getting that satisfication helps you serve purpose and feel more accomplished for yourself as well.\n\nOne last example of how always staying active can help influence your accomplishment is that you are acknowledging that you are given a purpose to uphold. It all just depends on how well you put yourself out there and willing to make a committment about it as well.\n\nA second factor why I believe you feel accomplished by doing something is that, it gives you a purpose in life and a feeling that won't be given again. Lacrosse has helped me put in an understanding on how self-satisfication doesn't come easy it takes time and effort. Many people that I have talked to said that they have always felt like their ciommunity helps them grow and feel like they should give something back as well. Throughout life, the experiences that you get can help keep you motivated on what you should and shouldn't do as well. This helps decrease inactivity and upbulid activity while you are doing something like helping your community, feeding the homeless, giving advice to young kids. This can help give you a self-esteem boost for yourself and let others know that you are willing to put in dedication for yourself. From my experience of helping kids with their homework afterschool it has always given me always a good feeling and making me proud that I am helping the community. . The purpose of always doing something helps us get different kinds of experiences, it helps us accomplishe what we are doing and gives a purpose to what we want to do in the future. This is a major factor on how well you live your life and how you want your life to be. In comparsion, when you are inactive you aren't benefiting from anything and you are just not getting enough experience for what you want to do in the long run. I do suppoort that we accomplish more when we are always doing something and it helps contributes to how we all live our daily lives.\n\nOne factor why I believe that this contributes to our daily lives is that, it helps you get an education on something new or just a job that you are interested in",

For example, some students may not be comfortable or feel safe doing such activities alone. However, school administrators must put safety and cost considerations first, ensuring that both students and school staff are comfortable with the activities and that the added costs are covered. These activities can even help to build leadership skills and reduce feelings of helplessness in teenagers.

These scientist do not stop even though they mastered science. They want to continue helping people from suffering this bad decease they want to grow and learn more they will not stop until they find a cure, so people can live as long as possible with their families.\n\nThird way to grow is by teaching other people.

A deathly decease that can kill you and there is no cure. Their are many others for example: Shakespeare, Beethoven, Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawkins, and Leonardo DaVince. Teaching other people can help you be a better person and letting people know your methods, so they can succeed with your help. Doing that will help yourself and other. Thirdly they can grow by teaching other people how to learn the same material . The quote says, \"Unless you try to do something beyond what you already mastered, you will never grow.\" I disagree with this statement.

For instance, teachers and mentors can help their students cultivate inquisitiveness and be courageous in tackling new challenges. It is therefore necessary to take appropriate measures to ensure that the process of invention and innovation occurs responsibly. In addition, these discoveries must be made responsibly, with the proper research and precautions being taken to ensure that the changes are in the best interest of society.. It is necessary to provide the right combinations of motivation and support to encourage people to think beyond conventional boundaries and make new discoveries. To ensure this, proper research should be conducted before any discovery is put to use, and the consequences must be studied to ensure that they are beneficial to society.\n\nIn conclusion, Isaac Newton, William Shakespeare, Ludwig van Beethoven, Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawking, and Leonardo da Vinci are prime examples of individuals who rose above their circumstances and pushed themselves to explore new ideas and create lasting change. Furthermore, knowledge sharing and collaboration also plays an essential role, as it creates an environment wherein the exchange of ideas can result in amazing discoveries.\n\nFinally, while new discoveries can have positive effects on society, they can also have unintended consequences. What made them stand out was their ability to think outside the box and push themselves to explore unexplored areas. The right environment can motivate individuals to think beyond conventional methods and put their creative skills to use. For instance, Newton developed his groundbreaking laws of motion, while Shakespeare wrote some of the most renowned works of literature in history.\n\nAlthough it is difficult to pinpoint any one factor that led to their success, it is clear that in order for people to flourish intellectually, they must be provided the right combination of stimulation and encouragement",

By trying everything you can find many actives you might be interested in. During this process you'll probably be trying different things you haven't done before, like sky diving.

It takes time to develop a talent or a skill. Trying different strategies can be helpful to find a talent as well.\n\nAnother way to develop a skill or a talent is to make a checklist. Sometimes by trying everything, you might not be able to find your talent, but you can always look at it another way. Sometimes the activities you are interested in and are good at doing, might not be your talent, because skills and talents can just be hard to find.

That is going me to build self-confident in me and I would start doing better during practice.\n\nAccording to my reason and examples stated above, I think true self-esteem comes from praise because it gives a student determination and help build self-confidence in a student. In my opinion, true self-esteem comes from praise because it gives an individual determination, and self confidence.\n\nAlthough, some people believe that self-esteem comes from an achievement because it gives self-discipline; for instance, a student did a poor job on a classroom test , that means he is not receiving any praise and didn't achieve anything, but because of that he will be self-discipline, so he would do a good job next time and receive an achievement.\n\nI think true self-esteem come from praise because it gives an individual determination.      . For example, if a student gets a non pleasant grade in class, and the teacher praises the student but also tell him to do better next time, that would give the student hope and determination to do better next time.\n\nIn addition, true self-esteem comes from self-confidence. To all the teachers, please praise a student work and let the student feel like the can do more and better. For instance, I am in a soccer club, but every time we practice I don't do better because I don't have the confidence, but instead of the coach cutting me off the team, he came up to me and told me that I can do better. He praised me and courage me to do better",
      "ai_text": "\nThe power of positive feedback from teachers should not be underestimated. \n\nIn addition to this, when a student knows that their teacher expects them to succeed, they will feel more confident in their abilities. This can provide a significant advantage when it comes to problem-solving and competing against one\u2019s own goals.. \n\nFor example, when I was younger, I remember feeling so proud when my math teacher praised me for studying hard and for scoring well on my tests. This recognition kept me motivated to dive even deeper into the subject matter and tackle every challenging problem I encountered with enthusiasm. As an example, a language teacher of mine once told me that she knew I could master a difficult syntax exercise if I put in enough effort. This pushed me to overcome my fear of failure and encouraged me to stay determined to complete the task.\n\nOverall, when teachers recognize and undercut the effort that their students put into their work, it creates a strong sense of determination and boosts self-confidence. With the right guidance and support, even intimidating tasks can be tackled confidently. As a student, being acknowledged for our hard work and achievements can inject us with a great sense of determination and self-confidence to strive for even greater heights",

Last reason is that you can put as many ideas you want and a lot of effort and ask the teacher to check your work to see how you doing working.

Conversely, when working in a group, it can be possible for one\u2019s focus to be shifted and diluted as working in a group is an interactive process. Working in a group can have many advantages; work can be shared more evenly, there is potential for more innovative ideas, and it can be a more social and enjoyable task. \n\nWhen it comes to ideas, working in a group allows for more creative freedom due to the helpful insight and ideas from others.

For example, when you meet someone, your first impression might be that you think she is supercilious and even a little bit mean. In my opinion, you must not keep in mind your first impression of a person, it's most of the time wrong. The first impression is the color and the shape of the object, like the physic and the attitude of a person.\n\nIn conclusion I would say that the first impression is sometimes right but most of the time it's not. In fact, the first impression is really important and sometimes true, but I think the first impression does not define a person, an object or a situation. Sometimes you can be disappointed because you didn't get to know the person because of your first impression.\n\nThe first impressions is not only for people but also for a situation or an object. It is normal to have a first impression, like judging, but you must not take the habit to stick with your first impression.      . Having a first impression is a human reflex, like having an opinion or a judgment. For example if you are in a library and you want to buy a book, the first thing you are going to do is looking at the cover of the book. But your first impression is wrong because you didn't take time to read the resume and you will find soon that the pretty book is actually boring instead of the black book which is really interesting. Sometimes a person can have a bad reputation because of the first impression he shows and it is not his fault, some persons just don't smile every time. The statement is \"the first impression is almost impossible to change\" which is a different feeling for everybody, but for me, I disagree. If it's pretty you will more easily choose this one instead of a book with a black cover and only the title, because it is your first impression. Therefore when you really get to know her deeper then you will find that she just had a bad day and that she is nice and sociable. We are doing it unconsciously.\n\nThe first impression is most of the time not real, you need to search deeper to make an opinion and when you really have an opinion, then, the first impression is not important anymore. It is not good to stay on a first impression because most of the time it's wrong.\n\nMoreover, the physic, behaviors or attitude can change an impression. An object can look nice but have a bad quality. Sometimes it's the contrary, a person seems really nice but in reality she is not, so your first impression was wrong. You have to get to know the person to build your own opinion",

When we are presented with something new, our imaginations often draw upon snap judgments and preconceived ideas to make sense of it. \n\nFor example, if you meet someone new that you don't immediately like, it can be difficult to shake the feeling and give that person a fair chance. \n\nResearch has confirmed that first impressions are hard to shake, and are often more influential than we think. It is often believed that what we feel and think upon our first encounter with something or someone will often remain with us for our entire relationship with them, and that changing those impressions is unlikely or impossible. Therefore, it is almost impossible to change that first impression.. \nThe idea that first impressions are almost impossible to change is common and pervasive in our society. In one study, participants judged actors more harshly upon reading their negative reviews than they did reading their positive reviews. \n\nI believe this statement holds a lot of truth",

Curfew benefits both teenagers and the law. at night. Furthermore, teenagers need to protect themselves from others, so that they will not get hurt. Curfews can raise the world to a higher level and make a clean society for all teenagers.

Even teenagers went to a ponit when they are playing video games they break everything they got on their sight, including the video game device that their parents bought for them.\n\nSome people might say that technology is something positive in our live because we create artifacts that make our lives more simple;however, technology is bad in our lives because we stop acting like normal people and we want to make our lives more easy, and that can affect how our saciety can be in the future if we don't control the use of technology..

Families have issues when their kids became agressive just because the prohibited the use of technology, and this reaction is trendy right now in different parts of the world. Now with the new technology people made video games, and now is the popular thing between kids and teenagers. Technology is an important thing in our lives at this moment and it will be more important in the future. When they go to school the most common topic between every kid is about video games, and that can affect their lives because playing all the time won't help anyone to study for an important test,or doing their homework.

Some of these people might say that there's no difference when they talk to a stranger online because we used to talk strangers in the street;however, there's a risk when you talk to this people online and it's the fact that some of them used fake accounts to hack personal information and other things. All we have to do is to connect the device to the TV and just play, but some people play the whole day and they don't want to go outside to play any sport, or going to a friends house. Now, this problem became a bad thing in our society, people don't go outside to meet friends, or just enjoy how the city looks, they prefer to stay at home and talk to people that they don't know who they are. While some people say this is a good thing, some people think it's bad for our lives because people stop interacting face-to-face in public, they don't want to get out of the place where technology is at, and some might have an agressive behaivor when they told them technology is bad for them.\n\nIn the past people always met in the street, there was no technology were with a single ring we can saw our friends into a little screen and talk to them.

For example,working alone can get you a better high score in the class then working in groups. For example some students don't like doing anything they just like to sit around and talk but on the other hand they are students that like doing there work so it's best to see that students like working alone then to be working in groups. If I was to explain to my teacher if I prefer to work in groups or work alone, I would pick work alone. In some cases some students don't let them talk to there friends because they think they are gonna make there child fail that class and some parents are gonna blame the friends then there own children. For example if a parent gets a phone call from a teacher saying oh your student is failing my class because there not doing there work like they used to before the parent is gonna feel bad because there gonna think oh my child is hanging out with kids there not supposed to be with. Working alone is good because you could think of ideas that some students can't think about. In some cases some students like working alone because they get to turn in there work on time so they don't have to fail the class. Another example, some students are really quiet and they are shy to talk to people so they work alone so they don't need to be behind everyone else who isnt doing there work.\n\nStudents often don't really get a lot of help from other students when they work in groups. Another example is when your working in groups it can cause you to not finish the work you started because your either talking or not focused in what your supposed to do. Students sometimes don't even do anything they just sit around and talk to there friends about other things then they talk about the work they need get done or there on the phone or playing games. Often some kids make the mistake on joining groups but then when it comes to doing work only 2 students do the work and then the other 2 don't do anything. Sometimes in life we want everything but sometimes we have to earn them all by ourselves not with someones help but our own help.",

Independence and efficiency are both major benefits that can help to foster an environment of intellectual inquiry and personal growth.. \nWorking alone often has a number of advantages over working in groups. When faced with a challenging problem, the individual is better equipped to simply focus on the task at hand rather than trying to coordinate a group.

They have to keep developing and study hard to get to a good collage and be prepared for their dream job to get a good amount of money and live a better life.. For example, high school student is not well-educated and is still developing, so they need to keep studying and learning in school to graduate and get to a good collage to study about their future career that interests them and the dream job they are wishing to work for. In high school, teachers and other faculties take education seriously and gets harder for students every year as they develop. For example, a high school student goes to work at a salon after school but they have so much homework and a test to be prepared for, but they have don't have enough time to study and accomplish their homeworks since their specific job is in the way. Students get a lot of homework and tests they have to study for and need to focus on education in order to graduate from high school and get to a good collage. In their high school years, students begin to get an idea of what they wish to be for their future career, so they are still learning about it and that's how they get a better amount of money, be well-educated, and live a good and healthy life. When they get a specific job during their high school years, it will take them away from these enjoyable and positive activities they and will have no time to do it when they have a specific career and school, which can also cause stress for students and will never find anything positive that they enjoy to do. It is important for students to do activites they enjoy to be healthy and have something positive and enjoyable to do. For example, a student plays football and really enjoys it and it gives them positive energy. Students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. When they get a specific job, they don't have time to do their favorite activity and also not have enough amount of time to study and do schoolwork, which can cause stress to students.\n\nIn conclusion, students should focus on studying and education in high school and not get a specific career that will distract themselves from school or any activities they enjoy to just to get money. A specific career will take them away from their dream job.\n\nStudents should not commit to a career at a young age because specific jobs will distract students from activities they enjoy.

Not only it will save our time but also it can give us opportunity to do a lot of extra activities and enjoy the day.. I also have missed my school bus; therefore, I had to walk the whole way to my school. As a result, I couldn't do well in that test, but if I was taking online class, I could take the test from home and be able to not get into all this trouble. I prepared well for the test, but on that day, I woke up late, and I realized I got late for my school. For example, if I get sick, I don't need to miss school. Online classes can save us from getting into all this kind of problems and save our time also. Online classes can help us in many ways. Although some say students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because sometimes, students might not understand their lecture or work on online classes, and as a result, they would not be able to do well in that class, actually students would benefit from being able to attend online classes from home because sometimes, students don't want to go to school because of sickness or being not at home, so they can stay home and take classes from wherever they are at that time and by taking online classes, high school students can save a lot of time and can work for more hours or do some other courses or activities.\n\nThose who believe students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home have their reasons.\n\nThey say sometimes students might not understand their lecture or work on online classes, and as a result, they would not be able to do well in that class. Again, if I'm not at home or may be I'm at my relative's place or my friend's place, I'll be still able to attend those classes.\n\nAlso, students would benefit from being able to attend online classes from home because by taking online classes, high school students can save a lot of time and can work for more hours or do some other courses or activities. I can stay at home and take my classes from home. One example is that, if I don't need to come to school to attend classes I would be able to make my own schedule and I can do my job for more hours in weekdays and save money for my college. For example, if they get a project or assignment, some students may have trouble in understanding how to do/complete that assignment or sometimes, they might not understand a topic from a lecture in online class.\n\nHowever, students would benefit from being able to attend online classes from home because sometimes, students don't want to go to school because of sickness or being not at home, so they can stay home and take classes from wherever they are at that time.

They may also miss out on the social and collaborative learning opportunities that traditional classrooms provide. \nOnline classes have been gaining in popularity among high school students. Furthermore, students may lack the motivation and self-discipline to successfully complete an online course.\n\nFor example, a student may take an online math course that allows them to complete courses in their own time. This increases flexibility and allows students to pursue other activities with the extra time saved, such as participating in extracurricular activities or setting aside more time for leisure.\n\nAt the same time, there are drawbacks to taking online classes. However, they may also be at risk of failing the course if they lack the necessary discipline and self-motivation.. Students may have limited access to tutors and course support. Taking online classes from home can provide students with numerous advantages. This allows them to schedule additional time for extracurricular activities or leisure, such as joining a local sports team or exploring new hobbies",

I did to for accepting my friendship with Generic_Name, if she really was a good friend, she would of told me she wants the best for me, and not lie about something that isn't even true, When someone lies to you, it's hard for you to gain their trust. It was a really nice day so we went to the park. Generic_Name told me she knew Generic_Name, and she told me so much bad thing about Generic_Name. We were going down the slide at the park, and I was with my brother, and sister. I had so much notifications from my friends, I totally forgot i sent them a text, I told them everything that happened. We got home, and we ate dinner, we all took a shower, and did our night routine. I don't trust a lot of people just my best friends, and my most favorite teacher, because the people that care about you the most, are the ones that want the best for you, they're not jealous of you, like Generic_Name was. Be careful in who you trust, and never change for anyone, because you are amazing just the way you are!. Generic_Name told me he already knew Generic_Name. Girls shouldn't change over a guy that doesn't feel the same way as you do, and boy's shouldn't either! God has someone waiting for you!\n\nIf you really trust someone, don't loose their trust! A lot of people can give bad or good experience to you, but you have to see who's being a bad friend to you, and who's being a good friend to you. I called Generic_Name that I needed to talk to him, so I gave Generic_Name my address.\n\nGeneric_Name came over, I told him everything that Generic_Name told me, he told me she was lying, because she's jealous of me, and she liked him, but Generic_Name didn't feel the same way as Generic_Name did.\n\nGeneric_Name told me that he liked me since the time, he made eye contact with me. When Generic_Name told me his brother's name, my heart started beating really fast, I was really happy that I would do anything in this world.\n\nGeneric_Name comes up to me, and says hi, I was really nervous, me and Generic_Name were talking while are siblings were playing. Generic_Name told me that all those bad things she told me about Generic_Name aren't true, she did that, so I would stop liking Generic_Name. My siblings are pretty annoying, but I still love them. Be careful in who you trust, there are several people that are there for you no matter what. You have to learn your lesson to the people that lie, your realize how you loose friends by just lying.\n\nMe and Generic_Name are now dating, we are focusing in school, because school is important, and no matter what others say, me and him are going to be happy, and no one will ever change that. I really didn't expect Generic_Name telling me that, I thought he would never like me. If there is something wrong with you, talk to the person you feel more confident talking to, you can talk to your mom, dad, your principle, counselor, dean, or anyone you truly trust.\n\nThere's always a time where you accept some bad friendships, that give you bad influence, but it's okay. He had a really cute little sister, and she's two years old, and her name is Generic_Name, and Generic_Name is ten years old.\n\nI asked Generic_Name what his brother's name was, he told me it was Generic_Name. It was really sunny, and warm, Then this cute guy came, and right away I text my friends about it.\n\nMy brother somehow started playing with Generic_Name. There are a lot of people that can give you bad influence, and a lot of people can give you good influence. The saddest thing is that we don't go to the same school, I go to Generic_School, and he goes to Generic_School. She told me she needed to talk to me, but in secret. We got to know each other, and now we're best friends.\n\nI'm so glad I met Generic_Name! We have so much things in common, we both like the same sport, which is soccer. Generic_Name is Generic_Name's ex girlfriend.\n\nI was very upset, and started crying, I went straight to my house, and Generic_Name came with me too, she's my best friend, and she's always there for me, when I really need her the most, I told Generic_Name what Generic_Name told me. So we went to the library. We had school tomorrow, and me and my friends were talking about it, but Generic_Name didn't seem as happy, as we all did. If I haven't told you what their names are, I'll tell you right now! My brother's name is Generic_Name, and my sister's name is Generic_Name, My name is Generic_Name",

I soon learned that this person had lied to me and was not the friend I thought they were. \n\nI learned the importance of trusting people, but also verifying if they will be a positive or negative presence in your life. This experience made me realize the importance of being able to trust other people and not succumb to changing just because it's difficult to stay firm about who you are. \n\nWhen I was younger, I made a mistake of accepting a bad friendship with someone who pushed me to make decisions I was uncomfortable with. \n\nIt's essential to determine if a person is a good influence or a bad influence. It's not wrong to be kind and have faith in those around you, but it's also important to know your limits, pay attention to the red flags, and be confident in your decisions and beliefs.. Despite their bad influence, I trusted them and allowed myself to be controlled for fear of losing them. Good influences are encouraging, supportive, and understand when you make the decision to be true to yourself. I lost more than just a friend, but my trust and faith in someone else. This can be done by assessing how someone makes you feel, what kind of advice they give you, and how they react when you refuse to do something they ask you to do. \nThroughout this essay, I will explore the importance of trusting people, experiences where my trust has been broken, and how to identify bad influences",

      "human_text": "Things can go really bad sometimes if someone doesn't ask for more than one option to choose from.\n\nFirst of all, getting different perspective from other people is anther reason for someone to ask for multiple opinions. Generic_Name decide that calling 911 was the smartest or lets say better idea. However, While Generic_Name was walking in the hallway she was asking a bunch of people to see where she had to go. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make better choices because they can get different perspective from other people, more option to choose from, and other ways to solve problem. For example, Generic_Name was having a sleepover with two friends. Generic_Name parents told her to just walk to school and see where other students where going. She went to the second floor and did not find the store so she asked another person and other person said \"It's on the first floor next to the ice cream shop\". One of her friends said call 911 while on the other hand her other find told her just trow water it will be fine your so dramatic. She went down to the first floor and went next to the ice cream shop got an ice cream and found the store. Generic_Name found the mall she had to find, she found the place had to go and her house didnt burn down. For example lets say Generic_Name moved to New York and it was her first day of high school, she had know clue where her school was nether her parents. When they got in the school Generic_Name had to go in a complete different way and Generic_Name was complete lost again. She asked a dude where it was and the dude said \" In the second floor\". While they were having fun cooking the oven caught on fire. Generic_Name was finking out she didnt know what to do \"AHHHHHH WHAT SHOULD I DO\" she said freaking out. 911 came and solved the problem.\n\nOverall, seeking multiple options can help someone make better choice by getting different perspective from other people, more options to chose from and can solve problems. She saw this girl with blue eyes and brown hair, \" \"She looks like a high school\" Generic_Name said, so she ran up to the girl and asked \"Hey what's your name\" Generic_Name she said I'm in high school what about you\" \"Oh same\" Generic_Name said. See asking multiple opinion is better than one because what happen if she only had asked one person they could had been room and she could had gone to the wrong room.\n\nLastly,\n\nAnother reason why seeking multiple opinion is good, is because it can solve problems. She got multiple answers saying to go to the same place. Let's just say somethings really bad could had happen if Generic_Name didnt ask for more than one opinion.. They were making food in the kitchen when her mom told her not to. Generic_Name was so happy she found that store because if she had it asked the other person she would never had found the store.\n\nSecond of all, having more than one opinion is better right?. Let's say Generic_Name was going to the mall, but when she got there she didn't know where this on store that she really wanted to go was",
      "ai_text": "This resulted in Generic_Name being able to network in greater depth and ultimately uncover a better job opportunity than initially expected. When Generic_Name was deciding on a major in college, they received advice from their parents, siblings, and classmates. This person shared their insights and experiences on the best business model to use, and it ultimately saved a great deal of time and money for Generic_Name. Instead of blindly accepting a single option, Generic_Name found more solutions when they decided to turn to their family and friends. As such, they decided to be more open-minded and consult those around them before making decisions that will have a high impact on their life.. People with different experiences often offer solutions that couldn\u2019t have been achieved by an individual. Moreover, it can help you solve problems that seemed unsolvable.

This resulted in Generic_Name having more options to evaluate and make an informed decision about the major that was best for their future. \n\nGeneric_Name had always been an independent learner who rarely consulted others for advice. So when faced with a big decision \u2014 like deciding on a college \u2014 Generic_Name typically hopped online, performed their own research, and then made a decision without ever seeking the counsel of anyone else. It provides people with more than one option and exposes them to different perspectives. When Generic_Name moved to a new city, there were a lot of considerations that one person alone couldn\u2019t have anticipated. Generic_Name began to recognize the value of seeking multiple opinions in order to make better decisions that would bring lasting success. When Generic_Name wanted to find a new job, they started to ask colleagues and peers for leverage and advice. \n\nSeeking multiple opinions also gives one more than one option to choose from. Generic_Name found all of this to be true through personal experience. \n\nHowever, this often lead to decisions that weren\u2019t the best for Generic_Name in the long run. For instance, when Generic_Name decided to start a business, they were able to get advice from an individual who had successfully started their own business ten years prior",

There is now less human contact. Therefore, individuals get too dependent on technology; For instance, Individuals use technology to communicate with others and they use it for location. In conclusion, the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology has a negative effect on people's lives because it can possibly impact their health in a horrible way and people get too dependent on technology, but they use it to help themselves.. Although those are beneficial perks, it causes people to be too dependent on technology. The limitation of human contact due to the use of technology has a negative effect on people's lives because it impacts their health in a negative way and people get too dependent on technology.\n\nHealth is very important, but people take good health for granted; To begin with, technology may impact individuals health in a negative way. This is important because instead of people completing tasks with technology, they can easily do it themselves. This is important because people need to be more aware of what can effect their health in a horrible way.\n\nThe use of technology is phenomenal, people use it in their every day lives. Furthermore, people may slouch down when they are using a computer. To illustrate, if people want a snack they can walk down to the store and buy it instead of ordering it online\n\nPeople think that the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology has positive effects on their lives since people with no available transportation can order online or if others live in a area that is dangerous, they can order online to receive the things that they want to be safe; However, technology has a negative impact since it makes people risk their health. For example, people's vision might get blurry and people that are looking down at their electronic devices impacts their neck position. In addition to that, people use technology to educate themselves",
      "ai_text": "But why is that? Simply put, it's because physical interaction is necessary for human connection. From the social media platforms that people use to stay connected with others to the devices that allow us to work from anywhere in the world, technology has undeniably reshaped the way that people communicate. Without it, people do not get the validation and emotional support that they need in order to lead healthy and fulfilling lives. Furthermore, people have become dependent on technology as a crutch--they utilize it as a way to feel connected with others, even when they don't have any real human contact. This disrupts the natural cycle of social interactions and disconnects people from reality, making it difficult for them to form meaningful relationships with others.\n\nMy own personal experience has demonstrated the importance of human contact in maintaining one's mental and physical well-being. I found myself anxious and overwhelmed, and I often felt lonely and isolated. It was only when I was able to get out of the house and meet with a few friends in-person that I was able to gain back my sense of control and calm my frazzled nerves. \nIn today's modern world, technology is an integral part of everyone's lives. And while the use of technology will always be necessary in our lives, we must remember to prioritize real human interaction as an essential component of our health and well-being.. Unfortunately, this has led to the limitation of physical human contact, which has had numerous negative impacts on people's health.\n\nRecent studies have found that people who spend less time engaging in face-to-face, social interactions are more likely to suffer from depression, anxiety, and feelings of loneliness. When I was stuck at home last year due to the pandemic, virtually every interaction I had was through a laptop or phone screen, and I really started to feel the negative effects of it",

      "human_text": "A similar expample is one of my cousins knew how to work in construction in El Salvador and he was really good at it, and when he just got here in US he knew that there was contruction sites and places that he could work on it. First no one was interested on my and after some seasons almost all team in Generic_City teams whant it me and teams from Generic_City I had like 7 teams that whant it me to play with them.\n\nIn conclusion I strongly agree with Michelangelo's words, its really common that the worst danger for most of us is to set our aim too low and achieving less than what we can do, I have had some reason and example but in all of them I realise that if I work hard I can accomplish more than I think I deserve.. One day I was playing soccer afterschool with some friends, and one of my friends dad was a coach for a team of Generic_City and remenbered that he said to all of us that if we whant it to play for him in his team. For next season I got a record that was not receiving any goals in 10 games and that lead me to win the best goalkeeper in that season. And I thought about that I could make it to play with which ever one, but when one of my friends told me that a lot of students were going to try out. I didn't accept to play with my school and next year I did the try outs just to see if at least I have a good level compared to others and the coach saw how I played and he put my on Varsity team. I have won for my third year in a row the best goalkeeper in the league. When he told me that I thought that wasen't good enough and that others could be a lot better than me, so I decided to not try out and I was already playing for one team of Generic_City and they told that if I whant it I could play for both and I answered no. I agree with Michelangelo's words, because some time when we whant to do things we start a low level because we think we aren't not good enough to do it, even known that we can do it good. That was not inetersted any more and told that he didn't have enough skills and it was going to be to hard for him. After I going and play my first games I sorprise my self and the team to cause I was playing a really good level and we won the league that season. I didin't whant it to play for a team because I felt that I was not to good to play for them. He told me that he was happy to take that joob and first he was wrong when he said that he had not enought skills for that joob.\n\nAlso another reason of why I agree with Michelangelo is that I remenber that around 3 and the hallf years ago I played soccer just with friends afterschool and we played just for fun and to relax. He said he was going to think about it and after a time he got the joob and it olny took him less than a month to know how they operated there and got hired more fast than others, because he was doing a good joob on everything that he has to do. I told him that yes It was going to be hard but he had a lots of skills and knowleage about it and it would take less time for him to learn what they do there. And you think others have more opportunitties to have success and you would not have any of them, and it only matter how fast you can learn and how good you do them.\n\nOne good example of it could be sports and I have had a time when something like that happened to me. And at the beggining of my third season our captain left ,and I got surprised that all all in the team wan't it me as a captain and my coach said that I was the captain of the teamI just got really happy.\n\nAnd won the league and the All Starts tournament that year and since there I have played like 8 season because every year there are 2.

These happened when I was at my last school Generic_School, I knew that the practices to try out for the teams were going to start in 2 days.

To quote the artist himself, \u201cThe greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark.\u201d By seeking to challenge one\u2019s self and remaining ambitious, a person can submit themselves to a path that may be difficult, but will ultimately lead to success in the long run.. Both of these present a clear link between Michelangelo\u2019s words and my own experiences. \nAs an artist, Michelangelo famously said: \u201cThe greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark.\u201d This resonates with me, as I can think of multiple times in my life where I have set my goals too low and have forgotten to reach for the stars, as it were. For example, when I was on my high school's soccer team, I was content to be a middle-of-the-pack player, when I had the potential to be one of the best players. On the soccer team, I pushed myself to excel on the field, eventually becoming team captain in my senior season. With any effort we put forth in life, we must challenge ourselves to set goals that will push our limits and boundaries, so that we can reach our maximum potential.\n\nAs seen in my own life, Michelangelo\u2019s words serve as a reminder that setting our sights too low is a greater danger than failing to reach an ambitious goal. Similarly, while looking for a job after college, I was all too happy to take the first offer that came my way, rather than researching other opportunities that could have made for a challenging, yet rewarding career.\n\nAs time passed and I set my goals higher, I began to see the positive repercussions of this decision",

What i would to is try to go find a person that has been through the stuff your going through/trying to do and take their advice it really help because that person has already been through those things or tried to do those things and went to someone that has already been through it to and took their advice and it really seem to work.\n\nThey might just also go get advice from multiply people to see which advice the person gives them is best. The reason some people do this is because they probably get the same advice the other person already told you and already tried doing that and it just doesnt seem to do anything really. You really just want a person to give you really good advice and see if it help you, if it doesnt help you go talk to another person and see if the advice they give you is more comfortable and helping. They can also just be going to person to person for advice to see if they are really there and car about you when your going through a really difficult time. What I believe is that your either trying to get attention or really going through a hard difficult time and the people you already went to and gave you advice didnt really help with what you going through or trying to do. It really is hard to find someone with good advice but you never seem to find a person that give you that one good advice. I would do the same and get advice from other people its just better it give you comfort and more things that you can do to help you . I would just go to someone that really gets you and is there for you and knows how you feel.\n\nSome people that do this just really want comfort because you never know what their going throw and really just wanna take everything off there mind and just want advice for all the things their going through",

Self-compassion has been extremely helpful for anyone struggling through difficult issues, as it promotes self-care and discourages self-criticism.

It was boring at first when you learn how to play it becomes a game not a sport. Softball is also good arm excise if you play it all the time. I have other talents which are that I am good at sports like basketball ,softball,, track, and soccer. When running in the track it is not about winning because the wind is in your face and running and your mind goes blank it feels so good when you are stressed. The only talent or skill I have would be doing tricks.     . The long jump is my favorite because when I jump it's like flying then I touch the ground and it is gone. I been doing it seen's I was little my dad wanted my siblings to be out of the house instead of being on our phones so we had to learn to do sports.\n\nThe first one I learned is soccer because it's just kicking a ball and running . In the middle east it's big but not like basketball or football the whole world loves those sports. I wish we play it at gym but we don't all we do is play field hockey. basketball because it is a mystery if you make it or not you just shoot and hope you make it .Seeing basketball players on TV I think help me to be better just like them. Soccer isn't big as well know as it should be. The cool part about soccer is doing the tricks and everything. I also think that mostly everybody can do it so in my opinion that is not a talent. In my school they have one for girls and one for boys but a lot of people come watch he boys one way more than the girls.\n\nThe next one is softball this one I just wanted to do something different when the other seasons are over. Thats why of all the sport my favorite is track. Also in the England they call it football instead of soccer but I get it makes a perfect name for it because you just kick it with your foot.\n\nThe second one I learned was track it wasn't that hard because you run or jump. That why running is my favorite it's not about beating the other person.\n\nThe other one I learned is I think it was basketball.

Because the students can learn more and get more information on there project. If i was the parents i would tell them do it yourself and learn how to finish the project the right way and get a good grade.\n\nHaving the teacher design the project is way smarter. Having feedback can help you a lot but staying with the teacher to design the project is the best idea. And how long they have to finish plus the students dont do anything in there break myself being a student i can relate to that. If it was a group project most of the kids would go with the smart people so they can finish it.

As we have two different people, we have two types of parents that one of them, they believe and they force their children that should take some classes like music, drama, or an art class instead of elective classes. They have to take main and elective classes that their counselor suggested to them. for example, I came from another country so I have to practice more in my English language and other main classes that I have in school, for these reasons I could not take an art, music or a drama class.\n\nSecond, another students just take those classes because their parents want to, so these students can not learn and enjoy from those classes and even they will hate from those classes. Fifth reason is, it gives them energy; so they can always be active in their life specially in their school.\n\nFirst, on the other hand, some students is special because maybe they came from another country or have special condition that they not required to take those classes because they have to graduate or because of their English language; so they have to study and practice more; and they can not require to take those classes. Second reason is, they can easily figure out what skills are they have in their life and out of the main classes in school. Fourth reason is, it is good for their health from all aspects. On the other hand we have some students that they like to take elective classes instead of those classes; and in opposite, we have students that they do not like to take elective classes.\n\nIn general, as we know the place of schools, we can easily discover that students need have some classes that they want to be and they like to enjoy it and has fun and exciting for them. As I said some benefit of those classes on above, they can improve their skills and they can go in forward to their life that they want to be.\n\nFinally, those classes can be help students a lot, but it has hinge on their status, and no one should not force students to take those classes unless they want to and they like to take those classes.\n\nIn conclusion, those classes should not be compulsory, because in general, each work should has be with love, until we can learn and help others and improve ourselves. for example, I saw my friends that he took a music class but he did not like that, but their parents force and required him to take that class, in summary he fell from all classes that he had in his school, and finally he did not graduate from school because of that.\n\nThird, some students that know English language include writing, speaking and listening, and has all A's in their main classes like Physics, Math and Chemistry and another main classes, they can take music, an art or a drama class",
      "ai_text": "When parents force their children to take such classes, the students often lose their motivation to perform, and may grow to resent the activity as a result. Art classes can help students practice an important form of self-expression, while music and drama classes can boost confidence and cultivate creative problem-solving and communication skills. \n\nHowever, some students may not want or be able to take these classes for various personal reasons, such as having limited free time or feeling overwhelmed by the pressure to achieve. \n\nUltimately, the decision to take music, drama, or art classes should be driven by the passion of the student. \n\nThe benefits of taking music, drama, or art classes in school are numerous. Students may lack an enthusiasm for learning the skills required for the class, and this can have a negative effect on their interest and the quality of their work. \n\nIt is often argued that making these classes compulsory could lead to a loss in the authenticity of the activities being taught. If the student truly loves an activity, they will be more inclined to take an active role in their studies, regardless of whether or not the activity is compulsory.",

Another example is that some times work in the school can be so noisily, also can be uncomfortable, but if you prefer to work online you get not problems because you can be more focus in your work, and also you can feel more comfortable working online.\n\nAnother example about why I think that working online is more benefit for students, is because they can have all the recourses, and tools necessary to work, also you cannot be feel bad about if you don't finish a test ,or a quiz at time in school, working online you ge all the necessary time to complete a test ,or a quiz, you can more time to do your homework, also you can eat everything that you want working online, in the school you cannot eat on classes time.\n\nIn conclution, working online is a more easy way for students to learn than working at the school, because had a good help and a lot of good reasons, and also a lot of good benefits.

I was only caring for myself most of the time, and when i get back home i would feel depressed and repugnant. But when you have a lot of friends and get to know other people, you can have an experience with them and its what makes life really entertaining. However being yourself is always good, but you can also change yourself if you feel the need to. but thats not true because it isnt there fault, because when you have others with you, it can have an effect positively and negatively. But as i said dont let anyone change who you are, being yourself is good but being alone simultaneously can be a bad thing. Leaving someone on there own can be pretty sad, helping them is what makes you a better person and gives you a better and easy life. But if you got rid of all of that then you would probably live a lonely life in deep and total solitude. Having others in your life is necessary because we can lift each other up, no one is worthless. Having other people is vital because you get through life more easily, and able to change yourself as you live on. In this world not everyone is born complete. The world isnt changing you you are changing yourself by just living a life with others around you, and you wouldnt notice that you changed either, but that is a good thing because now you know that if your able to change then anyone should be able to.\n\nThe last thing that is bad when you dont have anyone else with you, is that it can be really boring and not fun at all. But thats not true because all it takes is to change yourself, by having others in your life, or asking for help.\n\nIn conclusion individuality can be pretty awful and lead others to a path that is bad. But if someone else were to change you then that would be very bad, because they could be either delusional or emotionally negative of certain things in life. I have many important people like my mom,dad,sister, and very close friends who are also like family to me. When your all alone in your life, you wont have anyone to socialize with you, and keep you company. We live in a world where each and everyone of us, will always need someone or others to rely on. When your being yourself on my opinion it means you shouldnt have others change the way you are but its up to how you feel about yourself.\n\nI strongly disagree Emerson's statement on how individuality is a good thing, and i have various reasons or examples on this statement. And people who are negative all the time can provoke others to be a bad person, which is why they end up all lonely because they fear of others or hate others because they think no one cares about them. Having other people isnt trivial, you have to have faith in one another to get through life.\n\nThere was this one time where i was about twelve to fourteen years old, i would always struggle with my grades in the beginning of the school year, and have a strong sense of unease everyday i go to school because i always felt like wouldnt be able to provoke my self to do better in school and get better at socializing. As time went on i was able to change myself by others around me. When your with your friends you get to have lots of fun, like play games together, socialize, travel together, and get to have more and more experiences with each other and maybe learn more lessons in life.

However, there are also those who argue that extending school hours would put too much stress on students and disrupt their already tight schedules. Spending more time with instructors outside of the classroom can help create a closer, more meaningful, student/teacher relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, longer school hours could also result in stressful conditions for students. \nExtending school hours has become a controversial issue among educators, parents, and students alike. Longer school hours make it possible for teachers to spend more time exploring complex topics and for students to build deeper understanding of course material. However, when weighing the pros and cons, it is important to take all factors into consideration and ensure that any potential policy changes are in the best interests of all involved.. In addition, spending more time in the classroom puts more strain on students who are already trying to balance school with other responsibilities such as sports teams, internships, and jobs. Supporters of this plan argue that it would offer students more quality time to focus on their studies, develop skills, and interact with their instructors. Oftentimes, already tight student/family schedules could be disrupted due to the added time commitment. \n\nThe pros of extending school hours are numerous.

There was a player named Ronaldo he played for Generic_City when I was born, so I saw one of his soccer games in the T.V and I looked how he used other skills in the match against Generic_City. So then I used one of his skills and it worked. I started of in defense, then I started to up my way up, so then in three weeks I started playing striker. Professionals need communication to score or win a match. So I trained for an hour before my soccer tournament. So I used his skills for two games. For example my soccer team always use communication to pass to even score, and to win the match. So then I started playing more and more of it, and then I started playing in tournaments and leagues.

It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing\". The more time you work, the worth time you pay. Instead of finding a job, you do nothing, which makes you waste time and get nothing for your benefit. Do we accomplish more if we are doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose? Keep doing something helps you get a chance to accomplish and also makes the time you spend out is worthwhile.\n\nDetermine means you have reached a decision. As the result, you will lose weight and have a nice body. You will have no job, no money, neither future. For example, you are a senior in high school and you want to graduate this year; however, you are having trouble with your grades.

Similarly, school is that place which do not give their student's dream remain on dream; school helps students to give all those things which are needed to them; by motivating, encouraging and being inspiration for the students.             . Therefore, school is that place where it motivate, gives a strong strength to accomplish student's passions, suggest students to go through their interest and teach many significance knowledge about the educational experiences. Also, gives them a wings of hope to do something more and make their parents and themselves proud tomorrow.\n\nAs we all know that, if the students doesn't have that ability and interest in order to take a particular class then school never force students to involve in those particular class or field. They try very hard that how students will feel easy and comfortable. From school, students can learn optimum knowledge and experiences about the inside and outside of the books as well. School is the best place to evaluate the skills and the capability of each students. They should have only focus towards their study which is totally wrong.\n\nIf schools control student involvement in extracurricular activities then it can show a right path and right decision for the student's bright future. Schools are available with each and every information regarding the bright future of students. At this situation, we have seen many cases that parents do emotionally blackmail to their children. In fact, they share everything about their interest to their teachers and counselors because they understand them. In addition, school is the career building place for the students. We all know, every student do not wants to become a doctor and pilot. I believe that not only the students, everyone should follow their passions and see success will comes towards you itself because all we need is our happiness. By controlling students involvement in the extracurricular activities, many students can fulfill their dreams which gives them happiness and makes them feel special by doing it. If a student is good on photography then school is the only one who gives more information and put more efforts to help them through different strategies. If a student is interested on an art then teacher let them to take that class with a huge strength.\n\nSchool knows every skills and talent about their student because they spend more time with their teachers, counselor, friends and their coach than their family. Because of the schools control student involvement in the extracurricular activities, students can accomplish their interests, dreams and make their career in a particular activity in which they are interested, in which they see a big hope, declare it as their passion and happiness. In that condition, children sacrifice their dreams just to make their parents happy. School is the place where students get suggestion, get inspire, and get strength to accomplish their goals. It also provides an elective classes and other different activities to make them feel happy and special or in order to let their colorful feathers fly in the high sky and able to touch and feel it.\n\nAt the end, we can see that there are many benefits for the students which also teach them about the importance of extracurricular activities. It is only possible if the schools control students involvement in the extracurricular activities rather than giving decisions to the family and student for the involvement in the extracurricular activities. It's only because according to the parents, only doctor and pilot can make a huge money and has a great reputation. Instead, who are interested to become a famous photographer, to become a great dancer, singer and a great actor. Coach is the only one who teach, tell and motivate students about their strong and weak point through which student can do better today and give their best tomorrow than yesterday.\n\nSchool provides a beautiful and colorful feathers to the students in order to fulfill their dreams in which faculty they are interested and dying to do for it; only by controlling student involvement in extracurricular activities. But they do not share those kind of things with their family because family gives only pressure instead of understanding their children's interest. For example, if a student is interested and good on soccer but his parents do not support to his interest because they feel it's a waste of time. In other words, though their children are weak in math and science, but their parents wants to make them, a doctor, pilot or engineer. Achieving the knowledge based on the books or on the notebooks is common but achieving a knowledge by involving in the extracurricular activities is a different and extra. According to the parents their children should be good on knowledge based on books rather than extracurricular activities. But, school always support him. There are many students who do not have any interest on their study, who do not have any interest on the words written on their notebooks, who do not have any interest to become a doctor, engineer or pilot. But, talking about family, there are maximum parents who force their children to take a class and choose a career as they want. There are many parents who wants their children to become a doctor, pilot or engineer; though, their children doesn't have any interest on that faculty. They have their own dreams and interests on particular faculty. Students are also able to learn different knowledge through the school's coach",

Although people believe setting our aim low, and achieving our mark is less dangerous than aiming high and failing, nevertheless, aiming low, and achieving our mark is a greater danger because there's no limits to what people can do and failure gives motivation to work harder to achieve more and be successful in life.\n\nTo begin, setting our aim low, and achieving our mark is a greater danger than setting our aim high and falling short because there's no limits to what a human being can do and achieve. He's very short, and everyone doubted him and said he's too short and can't make it. This shows that no matter who the person is, they can accomplish a lot in life as long as they work hard. Clearly, everyone should always aim high and accomplish their goal to have a better life later on.\n\nFurthermore, people should always aim high even if they fall short because failure gives motivation to achieve more and come back stronger. Obviously, no should be scared of failure and everyone should aim high and try to be the best at whatever they do.\n\nOverall, the greater danger for most of people lies in not trying their hardest to be someone in life and aiming low to accomplish their goal because failure motivates the person to comeback stronger and have no limits. They lost very badly, but that didn't stop them from coming back the next year and winning the championship. That didn't stop him from aiming high and achieving his goal and becoming of one the shortest people to make it to the NBA. This proves that it doesn't matter how bad failure can be, as long as they come back from it stronger. For instance, The Golden State Warriors lost the NBA finals in 2016.

They will take care of you not only that you also learn how to deal with people in real life and experience stories that can maybe one day make you laugh or maybe some stories that we all have learned lessons from. School also provides lunch and breakfast which i think are very good for you. Hello, this is Generic_Name and i go to Generic_School. teachers would have very good history of good students and good grades teacher and students will have a good grade that can get them to college. School provides more social life more teachers, and more classes that you have to go to everyday. The choice is yours of what you want to eat. this issue is very common and i hear alot of students considering taking online classes .I think students should go to school and learn there because their will be all the help they need. for example: lets say you get in a fight with someone and you and the other guy both got in trouble over something silly during your time in high school you will realize that its not worth it fighting people therefore you should take at least 10 seconds to think before you do anything that you might regret in the future. You can start working along studying and balance your time and see what benifts you in the future. I say that becasue you will be with your family or working trying to save money for yourself but then you run out of time and your finding it very difficult at this point. You have to be very responsible on how to talk to people and how to act in public because it can get you in a serious trouble if you dont act straight. They have vegeteran food for those who are vegeteran and they got chicken and rice which i find pretty healthy. If your taking online school you might fail to organize your time and the year might just go to waste. There will be social life going on during school because you will be meeting all these people from different places which i find very intresting to meet other people from different countries. Today ill be taking position on an issue i have been hearing alot about .The issue is should students go to school or study online and take online classes. School will help you find your college there will bea class for you which is called career center that can assist you and help you find whats best for you and contact them if you decide.\n\nOnline or video conferencing (home school) is what people usually call it. It will be all your responsablity.\n\nStudents that go to school. If your teacher isnt there you have your friends in class they can help you figure out what you are stuck on school starts from 7:55 and it ends at 2:55. When online classes are providing the classes you need to gradute but its online and for free unless you are trying to take extra classes to gradute earlier. they care about how your nutriton is or if the food is fresh or not. There will be onone pressuring you to do homework or yelling at you if your late to school or class. You will have teachers that can tutor you after and before class if you need to they will be on you because that will benift both of you guys. You will have more freedom, there will be noone there to bother you if you get bothered easily or like to work quite. You can decide when to study or what days that will depend on your schedual if you are working or not. If you are homeschooled you dont have to worry about that. You are also getting so much help from the teachers you are not alone. If you are homeschooled you get to wake up whenever you want and you can go to bed whenever you want. The course will take you where you need to be its very straight forward , and they will quiz you very often to make sure your on the right path. You will have 5 minutes to get to each class otherwise you are late!! be on time always. They will have to wake up early around 6:30 - 7:00 to catch their bus to go to school because the bell will ring at 7:55. i think its a very risky move to do because you will miss out alot of good days and a great atmosipher to be in with all these people around you and the teachers who try to help you success in your life and help you achieve all your goals by going to your dream college.\n\ngo to school guys and stay in school..

Instead of the elective this class could also be a study time for students that are struggling with a class or an assignment. Others work after school and don't have time to do their homework. Most students take care of their siblings when they get back from school. Some people naturally like school and they want the hour and a half thing to happen. Three reasons why I think this should happen are students wouldn't have much homework. Do you agree with this? Three reasons why school board should add an hour and a half hours to school are, students wouldn't have much homework, schools could add another elective to the day, and teachers get more teaching time. Do you agree with me? If you do help me make this happen!. Sometimes the teachers is explaining to another student because they didn't quiet get it either. If schools added one more elective to the school day most students would be on board with the hour and a half idea. The school board should add an hour and a half hours of school to each school day. Most students have responsibilities after they get home from school. Teachers tend not to explain some topic well because they run out of time. Also a huge amount of students have after school sports either inside or outside of the school, sometimes both.\n\nThe second reason why the school board should add an hour and half hours of school to each day is because schools could add one more elective.

Data from a recent survey of stakeholders in the education sector showed 84% of those polled, including teachers, students, and administrators, expressed support of the idea.\n\nThe extra hour and a half could be composed of two 45-minute blocks of instructional time and one 30-minute block of time for recreation/socialization. \nTaking into consideration the potential advantages of an extra hour and a half to the school day, research has been conducted to develop an action plan for successful implementation.

If they come back home after 12am then there are gonna be actual real more serious consequences like being on house arrest, be on prohibition with an officer watching you, taking you to where you're supposed to be if any of those dont work then they will just be locked up in a Juvenile detention center for 4 weeks so they would actually have no freedom only time is when they get visitation time with there parents visit, and when they are released from that place. I think that setting a curfew time for teenagers during the week and weekends is good because it's letting them know the time they can leave there house, and the time they so there parents wouldn't worry about them leaving in the middle of night just to go out with friends. If there weekday curfew is until 10pm then it's acceptable because it's a school night so they at least just go home after school, change, and go out with friends until 10pm. If they get home after 10pm then they are disobeying, and breaking the law which would get them in so much trouble so like the consequences would be go to court, talk with the judge, and know what there punishment would be either going to be on prohibition for 2 weeks, having an ankle bracelet so if they try to sneak out it would alert an officer then they would immediatly would be put in juvenile detention center for a week, and if those consequences don't work then they would be offically be put with an officer to take him to school, home, and work so they don't try to sneak out again.

As an alternative to legal penalties, parents can choose to impose other forms of discipline such as discussion, restriction of privileges, or other punishments. Ultimately, it is important that parents and teens understand the consequences of breaking curfew and take the necessary steps to ensure it is followed..

Your observation on someone aren't truely who they are. Also however they want to come out to you.\n\nAlso communication is key its really important to have communication. Having good eye contact and hearing all the information of the conversation that they are giving you, makes them open more up to you.\n\nAdditionally, i disagree that the first impression is almost impossible to change. Until you actually meet that person and get to know them.\n\nPersonality can change your first impression. That shows that you understand the other person and feel comfortable with them. The reason why is that the way a person looks,personality, and their communication skills are always that change your whole point of view of that person. Its also like dont judge a book by its cover. You really dont know who you are really meeting. Communication skills are you by listening, can help you on your first impression. Therefore by taking the time, day, hours , and effort to get to know someone can benefit you from not judging a book by its cover. Personality is mostly who you are finding out, who that person is, can be life changing. For you not knowing who someone is can have a big change for you. From your first impression, when you look at them.\n\nHowever the way a person looks from your first impression isnt always who they really are. I disagree because when you look at a person for less than 6 seconds you think you know that person. The person can be good looking person you've ever seen and you really want to meet them. Until they are the wost person, that you hate so much. Until you have a coversation with that person at least for ten mintutes. This also works the other way around too, the person could be the ugliest person you have ever met, but you never gave them a chance. Thats when you realize that, that person is really good.             . First impressions are almost impossible to change. Personality gives great insights in that person and who they really are.

      "ai_text": "Someone who is animated and interesting can be much more attractive than someone who is shy and withdrawn. \n\nWhen it comes to looks, it is often said that beauty is in the eye of the beholder. \nThroughout life, first impressions are incredibly important. \n\nA person's personality may also be a factor in changing a first impression because it is often easier to see a person's true nature once conversation has been established. \n\nFinally, communication skills play a big part in how a first impression is perceived. By making straightforward changes in all of these areas, one's initial impression can be improved. Finding someone attractive or not can depend upon someone's individual opinion or preferences. However, while looks and body language are the ones that are usually noticed first, it is ultimately the attitude and communication skills of a person that can completely change a first impression. The way a person is initially perceived based on looks, body language, and attitude all play a significant role in how they are initially viewed. If a person can show that they are genuinely sociable, open-minded, and well-rounded, this can often counter any experience or appearance that was negative at first. \n\nTherefore, through one's looks, personality, and communication, a first impression can and should be managed so that an individual can make the best possible impact when meeting someone for the first time. By making just a few minor changes, a lasting impression can be left on another person that can outshine any first impression based on initial appearances.. However, a person's fashion sense, the clothes and accessories they wear, and even their grooming habits, can also change the way they are perceived. It is usually impossible to hide questionable communication skills, so by honing this aspect of one's personality, it is possible to make a lasting impression. The ability to articulate one's thoughts and communicate clearly can be a very powerful tool in making a positive impression",

If you're walking just with yourself then you can breathe, think, or just look at your surrounding look at the trees, houses if they're any near by, or the flowers. Playing volleyball, soccer and basketball are my favorite sports not only because it's fun but it's very competitive and that always gives me so much energy and having energy just makes the game better because it makes both the competitors competitive since the boost of energy makes them tensed and careful to make sure they don't mess up so they watch the competitor like a hawk. If I go out to bike or scooter I'm with either a friend or a family member because we like to bike or scooter next to each other and just talk or race to see who's faster and better at doing biking or riding a scooter.\n\nIf going to the park or playing a sport doesn't interest you and you just rather do something calming and relaxing then going on a walk, run or laying outside with a blanket on the ground and watching the clouds go by is an option for you. Being outside is important because Vitamin D if it's low then a way you can raise it up is going outside because the sun is apart of vitamin D so not only going out is good for you physically but it can also be good for you mentally. Riding a bike or a scooter around a park is relaxing if your just calmly passing through but if your racing with someone or yourself then it's fun so both ways is enjoyable to a person. Laying out a blanket and watching the clouds go by is probably one of my favorite things to do just because it's very relaxing to me, distracts my busy mind, and I find clouds beautiful so watching something that gives me peace to me makes me happy mentally and physically.\n\nGoing to the park, playing a sport, going on a walk, or a run is some of the things you can do outside and enjoy and have fun. Going outside can provide fun and enjoyable things to do for example going to the park with friend or people that you enjoy being around with, playing a sport, riding a bike, riding a scooter, and lastly a way you can spend time outside if you don't want to be so active is just walking around the neighborhood either with yourself or with a friend.\n\nGoing to the park with friends or people you like surrounding yourself with is fun and enjoyable because you guys can make up a game or play a game and play in different teams and see which team wins first. Fresh air we're use to being home all day and going out to get some fresh air willl cleanse you.. Laying out a blanket on the ground and staring at the sky is enjoyable to some people because watching the sky and how the clouds move is angelic and peaceful to them, so if you're wanting to do something that includes being outside and you don't want to do anything then walking, running. If you're with someone and you guys want to run then you guys can calmly jog next to each other or have a small conversation while running or run and just be next to each other for support and comfort. Riding them is exciting and fun. Playing with some of the park equipment is another way to have fun for example the swings to see who can go the farthest upwards, the slide maybe you guys can time yourself to see who goes down the slide the fastest, or the monkey bars to see who can get across the set of bars quicker or who can hold themselves on the bars the longest. A little of a made up game my sister and I played when we were younger was obstacle course so what I would do is tell my sister that the floor was an ocean filled with hungry sharks and that would make the game more intense because at the time we were very scared of sharks and so if one of us fell of the monkey bars or rope the other would have to start chasing the person who fell until the person who fell gets to their \"safe spot\" which the safe spot would have to be far.\n\nAnother thing you can do outside is play a sport, ride a bike or ride a scooter",

Students would have more time to complete their homework, and study for tests. There is a lot of ways to safe energy and conserve resources, but not all the pepole follows along with them. Otherwise going to school for only four days a week, will decease all the energy used in computer, and the gasoline the cars need to get students to school.\n\nStudents going to school only four days a week has their benefits and disadvantages. This is why bussinesses and schools should adopt a four-day week, with each day consisting of then hours.\n\nHaving a four-day work week has their benefits. Workers would only work four days and have three day weekend, they would have more time to rest, and have a time with their families. Workers would waste a very big amount of enegy due by the power tools they use",

Additionally, employees could benefit from increased job satisfaction and more flexible hours, allowing them to better manage their home and work lives. Finally, a shorter work week could make a positive social impact on workers, as studies have found that a four-day work week could lead to improved mental and physical health, greater productivity, and increased overall well-being.. \nThe introduction of a four-day work week has the potential to have a positive impact on a variety of economic, environmental, and social elements. For employers, there could be a reduction in overhead costs due to fewer hours worked each week, resulting in a more budget-friendly labor force",

      "human_text": "This is a good example of individuality similar to our way to live in the present. The church killed to protect the true behind Maria Magdalena. On those old times there were many poor people who were opressing by the church, they sufer in the church's hands. Based on this I state that we can share our ideas of individuality and do not let our corrups politics to opress people's rights.\n\nIn the present we have a huge amount of successful guys because of individuality. Individuality can be hard but not impossible. To catholic people Jesus's mother is saintly. To be honest, I prefer being painting rather than be runnig for no reason. We live in a world with influencers that try to persuade us to be like them. The politics want us to do what they want to their advantages opressing our rights just like the church did with the protestants during the crusades. The author of \"Maria Magdalena was very brave to wrote about those things. He was very successful because nobody used to talk about this, now they do. My art's teacher gave us draws made by her.\"Ready to paint\" she used to say, but I was so rebel that I made my own draws just because I though her draws were so bored. To the author of the book \"Maria Magdalena\" she is just a lie's layer. We own our thoughs, thus, we should do ours ideas not somebody else's ideas\n\nIn the book called \"Maria Magdalena\" based in the movie \"The Davinci code\" states the ideas of one individual who thalk about the true behind the story about Maria Magdalena ( Jesus' mother). Now we, the tenageers, are more prepared to develop our ideas and beliefs. Individuality is the idea of freedom of thoughs, but why we are concerned what other people think? Let's be honest everybody had copied at least one time in a test or quiz just because it was more eassy to coppy than being trying to remember the anwer that obviously you did not know. Their sanctuary, the church. I was a little girl taking individuality decitions and I did not know it\n\nIn my conclusion I am agree with individuality, If we want to spread the individuality, then we should start saying what we think, because the bravery of the unexpected ones, will persuade the shyness ones. In this book he shared us a little part of what was to be different from the others and take their own decitions. The victims decide to follow their own beliefs and the consequence was the death. Constantly, my mom develop the ideas of individuality in our family. I prefer the hard way, so then I would be proud of my achievement just like Ralph waldo Emerson said: \"To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplisment\". On those times existed the crusades in spanish the \"cruzadas\" in which the church fought the protestants to convert them in their cristianity if they negated to accept it they killed them. Parents now teach their offspring to take their own decitions knowing the consequences of this. One year ago I decided to start to work, and I am very proud of my decittion.\n\nI remember my first day of kinder garden, All the kids playing and runnig around the field. Do not choose the easy way. The influential ideas of the past are not in our day to day anymore",
      "ai_text": "It is a way of embracing our uniqueness and expressing ourselves fully. and Mahatma Gandhi.\n\nIn conclusion, individuality is something to be celebrated and embraced. \nIndividuality is a concept that has long been celebrated and valued. In today's world, making individual decisions and going our own way can be frightening, but it is ultimately very rewarding. Dan Brown's novel \"The DaVinci Code\" is a great example of this, featuring an individual's quest for the truth. This has been an incredibly rewarding experience and has taught me how powerful it can be to make individual decisions.\n\nMany authors have explored the concept of individuality in their works. In today's world, being an individual is more important than ever before. Even when referring to historical events, the idea of individuals impacting the course of history is evident, through figures such as Martin Luther King Jr. His literary adaptation of \"Maria Magdalena\" similarly focuses on an individual's journey towards self-discovery. Ultimately, I chose to take a risk and follow my dreams. This is why my parents have always encouraged me to be an individual. When I considered starting my own business, I had to make the individual decision of whether it was the right move for me. Great individuals throughout history have had a significant impact on the world, and I believe that each and every one of us can do the same.. From an early age, they taught me the importance of making my own decisions and developing my own ideas.\n\nAs a young adult, I have taken this philosophy more seriously, particularly in my professional life",

All the inventors, who has invented things first used their imagination to create an image on their mind to see how it will look like, which helped them to make the item. I think many parents are strict and tells their children to stop imagining things and always study, which I believe education is very important but telling someone to stop imagining is not quite right, Once I read in a article where it said that imagining thing is a natural habit and you will imagine things unless you have disability or blindness.\n\nOnce I also read a article that says that according to physcology imagining things is important for our brain .

We like too watch other people do it or we like to do it ourselves. Do not have to listen what other people say about what you think and how you should live your life. Humans like to listen to their friends or family members ideas too see if they can help them out. What career they want to do in the future. Do I think we choose our traits? In this world people choose their pathway. When I turn sixteens years old I went out to look for jobs i wanted that feeling where I could earn money.

Sculpting is known to even reduce levels of cortisol - the stress hormone - as well as providing a unique outlet for different perspectives and emotions.\n\nOverall, art can provide tremendous benefits as an activity, whether you're using it to express yourself or to reduce stress. \n\nPainting and drawing are popular activities for relaxation because they allow you to fully express yourself without needing any other supplies",
      "instructions": "Task: Investigate different artists and how they use art to express their feelings or tell stories. Investigate different ways to use art (e.g. painting, drawing, building) as a method of relaxation. Explore the benefits of using art as an activity."

      "human_text": "People that have wanted to start their own coffee shop business or other kinds of business, doesn't always work out for them for some reasons and are not very successful when doing the planing their ideas and would want to hire someone to help them come up with more ideas. Its actually a good thing to fail in life and people that know what its like to fail would get inspired to work extra hard and take more time to look over everything. They would also stay on the positive side and have family, friends, and other people supporting them and cheering for them no matter what happens if they fail or don't fail.\n\nThe British prime minister probably has fail in the past years when he was younger and was successful after he learned from his mistakes. People will learn from their mistakes and it will take time for people to be successful in their life and accepted that they failed for the first time.\n\nIts very important for people to know that if they fail they can try again and can go back and check to see what was wrong or think to them self what they did wrong, They can learn from their mistakes and not give up when they fail the first time.\n\nPeople that have failed in life know that its not a bad thing when they fail. . I agree with the Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, that failure plays an important role for some people in life, If they fail once they could get it right the second time and succeed. Nobody is perfect in life thats why we fail in life to see what we did wrong and make sure that it doesn't happened in the future.\n\nHere is one example, If someone wants to open a coffee shop the person would need to get a loan from the bank so they can purchase a building and to start their own coffee shop business and come up with the name's for the coffee shop, drinks, pastries, and food that will be on the menu. The person might not be happy when he or she were unsuccessful for the first time to try and open their own business and take a few more months to come up with more ideas to be more successful for the second time.\n\nOverall, I think that failing is good thing and not a bad thing its just people dont have to give up after they fail the first time they need to give another second chances until they get it right. People should get inspire to keep working hard when they fail and not quit, because not everyone in the world is perfect in life",
      "ai_text": "Furthermore, those who experience failure can find solace in the stories of successful people who overcame their struggles and rose to success. Equally, an effective support system is essential for those going through difficult times, providing emotional and physical assistance to those who need it.. Numerous factors come into play, including external factors such as the economy, which can dramatically affect a business's success. It is therefore important to consider all possible reasons why a business could fail and devise a plan to help business owners come up with ideas to ensure success. \nHaving a successful business takes more than just good ideas and hard work. A great example of this is Winston Churchill, who despite suffering many disappointments and failures in his lifetime, managed to make a huge contribution to society. This illustrates the importance of perseverance and continuing to pursue goals despite any setbacks",

People are either in collage or working when eighteen. People know between right and wrong, need and wants, and what they wanna do in life. Guidance from others is a idea or option, people will still have to make the decisions.          . moreover when people are eighteen they start to make important choices and actions about their life.\n\nWhen a person gets older they learn between right and wrong. Sometimes people make the decision not to go to collage or sometimes go to collage then drop out and thats a decision a person makes because they think its the best for them.\n\nin conclusion people make decisions and learn from it. That's a decision people make before graduating and thats a very important life choice. In high school you get to meet a lot of people and make new friends, in addition you make a lot of decisions. i agree with this statement because once people get older as a person they know what they are doing and what they want. The decisions people make and ask their self are, should i be friends with this person, should i go to this class, and sometimes people don't wanna continue school. In the end people make the decisions.\n\nWhen a person turns eighteen they are an adult now and probably out of high school. for example a person should never spend their money on something they don't need and knowing if they do they'll be broke and have financial problems. people know what are the needs and wants in life, they learn this through out life and the one to make the decisions.\n\nHigh school is where people start to have an idea or know what you wanna do as a career.

      "ai_text": "\nRalph Waldo Emerson once said, \u201cWhat lies behind us and what lies before us are tiny matters compared to what lies within us.\u201d Emerson's words provide the backbone to the idea that mastering something important is essential in order to succeed in life. He followed his dream and his success is now admired by people all around the world. It is also known that positive words have a powerful impact on people. Oftentimes, it can be overwhelming by the amount of advice one may receive from friends, family, and colleagues in regards to what direction life should take. Instead of focusing on someone else's opinion, it is important to focus on one\"s true passions and dreams. Not all advice will be of use, but when taken with an open heart, it can help foster optimistic mindsets and create an attitude of resilience in the face of obstacles. Ultimately, what matters most is to pursure one's own dreams and find a way to make them a reality.. Success can be achieved by pursuing something that sparks joy.\n\nTake for example the success story of Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook, who pursued his passion in computer science and declined a lucrative job at Microsoft. Constructive criticism can be used to help one reach their goals. As the saying goes, \u201cA dream doesn\u2019t become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work.\u201d Unfortunately, some people may try to bring us down and discourage us from pursuing our dreams. Little words of encouragement can act as boosters to get one back to their feet and back on track. Whether it is something said in a role-model, movie quote, or from a stranger, even the slightest remark can greatly affect someone's perception of success. Negative people will likely stand in our way and with the right amount of resilience and focus, it is possible to push past the doubts and move forward.\n\nThough unsolicited advice is often difficult to process, it is important to remember to take something away from it that is valuable",

Then one of the kids came up to me and ask what do you like I told him what I love like animals, sports. When we took our test we both got A's. Its best for students to be in school rather than be home school.. For example, In history there are students that don't understand they would just sit in their seats and not ask for help. Even though lots of students like to work at home, I strongly believe its better to work at schools.\n\nStudents should have friends in there lives to be more social in the world. Most people think its best for kids to be in school than in their homes because it can help them in their social life, make friends in there world instead of being lonely. In my science class we have projects to do we get in a group of friends to get a good grade and we see a student work by him self. Those were the things we both like too he was my first friend in that school. When we got our projects back we got an A and the student got a B. When I was younger I use to switch schools to schools then I went to a school called Generic_School I was the only new kid in school I had no friends I was the quite in class, then one day I join a club called book club we just read books and talked about what happen in them. Students should be in schools because they should be comfortable when meeting, talking with other students because they might have things in common.\n\nAt school students can help each other out in class if they dont understand something. I am writing about should students work in schools or their homes. This shows that in schools we should be with other students to bring in ideas, ways that others can't see.\n\nIn school you can be well taught and understand better when people like teachers, or other students help them. In my class students can be helped by fellow classmate or the teacher.\n\nDuring school projects students can be in partners or in groups to get a good grade",

This can be particularly beneficial for students who are more independent and self-motivated and need less guidance. Social interactions, academic improvement, and peer support are the main choices that need to be weighed in this decision. Students are able to work in a comfortable and distraction-free environment. They can utilize their differences to collaborate closely on projects, which can in turn lead to better academic performance. At the same time, they can build relationships with peers and have support from each other in a positive and safe environment. At the same time, students can maintain contact with their peers and teachers online through video conferencing to ensure they do not miss out on the social connections while also avoiding potential problems of in-person interaction. \n\nWhen students work in a school setting, they benefit from frequent social interactions and the varied perspectives of their classmates",

Students being educated at home gain more time to study and make up their own rules but responsible with it. Even though socialization in the school environment allows students to make friends. There many more opportunities with public and private schools. The conclusion of the argument was that it is highly doubtful that the lack of interaction could affect the student in adulthood. In the near future, school systems and all districts should provide distance learning.. Learning from home doesn't have the distractions that a classroom has. This is another reason that learning from home benefits students. Allowing any students to work on their own schedule help them become more motivated to work on their assignments. If a student learns from home they will feel more relaxed and comfortable and won't stress about work. One of the reasons students get distracted in the first place is because they are in a class where other just fooling around which makes others who want to stay focus feel uncomfortable. The students cannot always work at the pace set by teachers. In school, you are stuck at a desk listening to the teacher's teachings for six hours and have a limited time to eat and take bathroom breaks. So for all that matter it was you choose from not what want, it what you need.\n\nStudents should be offered classes online or at home because it is less distracting and less stressful. Making friends from home would be difficult without social interaction. With a more flexible schedule, students would be more likely to succeed and make good grades. Some students have trouble working at a school because they cannot understand the material at the pace set by teachers. In public schools and private schools, depending on the teacher, cheating is hard to do. Students complain about having too much homework and when working at home there is not any homework. Because instead of worrying about the rules the students can focus on their studies. Because of this, students will feel less pressured and get better grades then they would have if they were in school.\n\nThere are still a few reasons not to do distance learning. People from different colleges don't go to student's homes and try to advertise their career options. On the other hand, schooling at home, the students can easily look up the answers on the internet on a different device. Additionally, that there are no misguided rules about tardiness or how to dress. The flexibility of the time students are allowed to complete work would benefit the mental health and grades of the student. Public and Private schools are great places to socialize during free time. But there is other way around, if you are home, you can eat and do what you want when you want. The students can work around their parents schedule instead of the parent working around the student's schedule when it is time do some distance learning. As a result of this, students won't lose focus on the work they are doing resulting in better grades. Many students all over the world successfully take some, and even all classes from home. Would it be surprising to know if students to know that students learning at home helps them not stress out as much? Stress is mainly caused by the students getting to much school work that cannot be handed in one night. Because it can be done by a touch of a good night sleep, students rise up in morning fresh and have a flexible time schedule. Learning at home and not at school helps students to benefit themselves to get better grades.\n\nOne of the advantage of homeschooling is it can be done anywhere and at anytime. Distance learning can improve certain students learning process by having a more available schedule and by letting them learn in their own way.\n\nWhen taking a test or notes at school there are many distractions that can make students lose focus on what they are doing. If everyone goes home to attend school, funding for public schooling will fall and teachers will lose their jobs because of budget cuts",

Although it offers many advantages such as flexibility and reduced stress levels, there are some key disadvantages to consider, such as a lack of social interaction and increased distractions. Ultimately, when deciding between distance learning and attending a public or private school, it's important to take into account not only the potential benefits, but also the potential disadvantages of each option.",

That's when you realize that this person is the one for you. Until they were the worst nightmare and you hate them with a passion. The guy/girl could be the ugliest person of the time, but you never gave them the time of day. The reason why is that the way a person looks, personality, and there way communication skills are all ways that can change your whole point of view of a individual.

A person's attitude, values, and sense of humor, for example, can only be truly observed over a longer period of time. A person's looks, personality, and communication skills all play major role in how we perceive them initially. However, this initial impression doesn't always tell the full story and it's possible that person B may actually be more competent over time. Person B, on the other hand, is wearing more casual clothing and is more reserved in his speech. Finally, engaging in positive conversations with those you meet and actively listening to their ideas can help establish a positive initial impression.. Developing communication skills such as the ability to ask meaningful questions and make meaningful conversation can also be incredibly beneficial. Building a strong sense of presence by making eye contact and conveying confidence in one's words and body language are also essential. Take for example, two people you meet at a party.

You have to actually think about what you actually want to do to accomplish in life.        . Sometimes being yourself doesn't goes as plan as you thought it going to go. Most of the time people gives wrong advice to others. For example, if someone is having a hard time being a good citizen and they are always getting into trouble, then yes changing them is a good thing. Sometime people try to change you because they thought you couldn't succeed with what you wanted to become or wanted to accomplish. Go with that decision that you think is right and don't allow nobody to make you do something that you don't think is wrong.\n\nHowever, there are people who think allowing someone to change you can be an accomplishment. Only if it is for the good. Most of time people doubt others. Having a strong feeling that being by yourself is a good decision for you, that a good thing because thats means you have no problems of being by yourself.

      "human_text": "Therefore if you have communication you don't have to do as much work; just have to gather your thoughts and put them together and let it make sense. It's actually amazing how someone thoughts can open multiple thoughts for an individual that didn't even know they could think of such thing,that's why I stress so much about group work it can be rough,frustrating,inpatient but at the end its all worth it. Have you ever worked individually on an assignment and was stuck and had no motive to keep pushing? well if yes I'm here to tell you why working with a group is more beneficial then working alone. History shows you that having a destination pushes the brain to do better and has a big effect on the outcome.\n\nPersonally,as I work in groups I collect other peoples ideas and analyze their way of thinking and use it to my advantage. Therefore if everyone in the group has a designated job too do no matter what they're working towards the same goal. Also a group is not always a maximum group of 5-7 people it can also be about just 3 maybe even two.\n\nGroup work has more pros than cons; criticisms is in the category or pros if were being honest, even if your partner not giving you as much feedback your at least getting something. While people are working alone they could be working on their work place readiness skills.\n\nHowever,some may say working alone is much more precise than working with a group,In some ways they are correct. Sometimes group work may be challenging but it also helps you in the real world which us people need which takes me to my next topic; respecting everyone ideas and having a goal.\n\nGroup work isn't always about who has the most ideas or who can put it together and what not,It's more of letting people get their thoughts out. Also you can state your own ideas how and where you want it to go without someone thinking otherwise of that thought. All around working alone much faster than working with a group but if you ever want to get to that next step/level your going to have too sit down with a group of peers and express your feeling which takes:character,time and patient.\n\nI have come to the end of my writing I hope I have changed your perspective on things and hope you even learned something with reading my essay. Group work has to be one of the most easiest things as an highschooler group work assignments are the best,hearing what others have to say can really open up the brain. Having one or two individuals speaking over everyone can affect the whole group chemistry,making sure everyone is conformable before you start is very helpful of the process. Another way you can think of it;lets say you were working alone and you got your project done,well that's okay but wouldn't you want to know more about whom ever you are? wouldn't you want to get pushed out of a shell and experience new things. Yes the process goes faster and there is less to do;as a team may have to do more before they get started. So take that next step and go interact with others to better yourself!. I believe working with a group is far more easier than working alone,communication is key. In my opinion goals are good when doing anything when there is a goal to accomplish it just pushes the work ethic to obtain that goal. This helps expands the thought process as many can see a different perspective on things. Working with a group you have to come up with a goal;However every goal has a destination. Than not getting anything at all in my opinion people that work by themselves are just flat out :selfish,hard headed,and think they're too good for everyone. I just want everyone out there to know accepting critsm isn't bad neither is accepting that you are wrong and someone else is right",
      "ai_text": "Having a common goal and communicating it through all group members ensures that everyone is on the same page, reducing conflict and misinterpretation. \nWorking in groups has a range of benefits compared to working alone. This makes it easier to come up with creative solutions to problems. \n\nUltimately, working in groups has many advantages compared to working alone. \n\nFrom my own experience, working in groups can be incredibly advantageous. Furthermore, I was able to use group based activities to develop proficiency in problem solving and negotiation, essential skills in the real world. Collaborative efforts have the advantage of combining a variety of perspectives; when it comes to tackling an issue, two or more people working together can provide different perspectives than a single individual. Group work has enabled me to learn from the collective knowledge of my peers, and allowed me to develop my capacity for collaboration and communication. It is an efficient way of working and allows people to benefit from different perspectives. Additionally, groups can provide helpful and constructive feedback to its members, which can help refine ideas and identify potential weaknesses. Furthermore, group work can foster strong teamwork skills, communication, and problem solving skills - all of which are necessary out in the real world. It is also essential to respect each other's opinions and points of view in order to create an effective atmosphere towards achieving the goal.  For these reasons, group work should be considered as a preferable method of working..

By continually practicing, you will most likely achieve at it.. A similar experience I had was when I was in my elementary school years when I was eating dinner with my family. Another experience I had was when I was doing chores like cleaning, vacuuming, washing the dishes, and taking out the trash. My family was impressed at how much I've eatan. However, to remedy that, if people continue practicing at something challenging, there is a higher chance that they will achieve at it. Upon growing into teenagers, they will learn about harder math skills like harder math, reading, and they will even apply for a job. When they get to kindergarten, they will learn about math, reading, and writing. It will make people happy that they achieved at it. From that point on, they will grow into toddlers where they will learn about letters, numbers, how to share with others, and some easy words to pronounce. As a result, I grew so much that I was taller than most of my family members, and it's still true today. When they grow into 10th graders, they will learn about business, marketing, and learning to drive. In elementary school, I learned about mathematics from addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Then they achieve at it, then they will start talking. That is what Author Ralph Waldo Emerson said in his quote. It was scary at first, but overtime, I've been continually practicing using these tools, and now I'm an expert at using these equipments. I would finish almost everything from meat, soup, etc. Some people think that when they master at something they've never mastered at, then they will grow up. \"Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.\n\nAn example of this statement are babies starting to walk. It will certainly make people joyful that they achieved it.\n\nAs Emerson said in his quote, if you try your best or master at something you've never excelled at, then you will grow up and feel joyful about it. Another experience I had was in elementary school. A similar experience I had was when I was starting Automotive Technology was when I learned about how to operate tools like wrenches, ratchets, how to lift up and carry things like tires, how to use safety equipment, and how to operate electric tools like machines, impact guns, and drills. Back then, it was a little tough at first, but I kept practicing, and now I can excel at this.\n\nIn contrast of Emerson's quote, if people keep practicing, but they don't seem to achieve it, it might make them feel upset and defeated. I continue to eat a lot and I will eat more in my future. Back then, I used to eat a lot, and that is still true today",

With persistence, I was able to achieve my goal and even surpass it. Although growing requires a degree of risk and vulnerability, it is those who take such risks and step outside of their comfort zones who find the greatest rewards.. They felt a sense of failure and disappointment quite keenly and I could see how this had the potential to discourage them from doing things that were outside of their comfort zone. I once set a goal of running a half marathon, a goal that seemed lofty and daunting given that I was a beginner runner. Despite their initial enthusiasm for their goal, they eventually lacked the confidence and perseverance to stay committed to the goal.

      "ai_text": "This rapid path to graduation enables students to save time, money, and graduate earlier than if they had followed the traditional four-year graduation path. But what are the pros and cons of such a program? And how does it affect the broader student body? \n\nThe primary advantage of the three-year graduation program is that it can enable certain students to save money, time, and graduate earlier than usual. \n\nThe three-year graduation program offered by Generic_School certainly has a number of pros and cons, and can have considerable impacts on student body. This could be especially advantageous for students who are paying their tuition on their own, or who have already found a career path and would like to pursue it as soon as possible. This rapid-path to graduation may also easier for students to feel overwhelmed by the amount of coursework they need to complete in a compressed time-frame.\n\nWhen it comes to its impact on the broader student body, the three-year graduation program could create a situation of inequity between those who can and cannot take advantage of the program. By compressing the traditional four years into three, students can take the same courses to obtain a degree, but faster. Additionally, the three-year program could make it harder for students to receive aid from scholarships and grants. With less time to experiment with courses, students may end up deciding on an academic path ahead of time without the possibility of changing their mind. \n\nHowever, this program could also have some downsides that must be considered. \nIn recent years, Generic_School has begun offering a three-year graduation program to its students. Therefore, it is important to weigh the pros and cons before deciding if this program is suitable for each individual student.. Additionally, it could create a situation of overcrowding in certain college courses due to the larger number of students taking the same course in one given semester",

Some of the student who come from the other countries just by themselves also graduate in three years, may be because their entire family lives in back home.\n\nSuppose, they do not live good life in their back home. So, they can make their own purchases, like phone, paying phone bill, going out to eat with friends, going on a trip with friends, etc.\n\nStudents can also have a full time job who do not want to go to college.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with graduating from high school in three years by working hard.\n\nSome students do it to make their dream become true faster, some students do it for their family problems, some students do it for their own problems. To graduate one year earlier, students must take extra online classes or elective courses. That's when students want to give them a better life by bringing them here. There are some of the school districts offer programs that allow high schools students to graduate in three years. So, that way their family will not get stuck anywhere for the economic problems.\n\nFinally, this idea to graduate one year earlier is good for them who want to finish high school earlier, to go to college and also to have a part time job on the other hand. Student have permission to graduate high school earlier and enter work force earlier to help their family with economic problems. After all, graduating from school is most important thing in every students life. To bring them here, the students have to be able to have enough money and to feed them enough after bringing. There are also some good students who always have good grades in all the classes. It is a good idea to graduate one year earlier and enter college or the work force one year earlier because if students finish high school one year earlier, they can admit into a good colleges and fixed their career little faster for lifetime, they can help their family with economic problems, they can also make their own purchases.\n\nInitially, this idea to finish high school one year earlier is the best idea for them who want to fixed their lifetime career earlier. And students can do all these works earlier if they finish high school in three years instead being in a high school for traditional four years.\n\nSecondly, this idea is good for the students who's entire family already lives here, and there are some economic problem in the family. They graduate in three years and get a better full time job and help their family with economic problems.

For students interested in a technical or professional field, being able to jump-start their education and begin working towards their dream career a year earlier can open many doors in a much shorter amount of time. Graduating sooner gives students the opportunity to travel home more often and strengthen those connections in a much shorter amount of time.\n\nIn conclusion, graduating from high school in three years instead of the traditional four can open many doors for students in terms of career, family, and financial freedom. Students graduating early are able to have more free time to return to their home town and spend quality time with their family and loved ones and help build stronger emotional connections with their roots. \n\nAnother potential advantage of graduating almost a year sooner is the potential for financial freedom. This can reduce the amount of debt students need to accumulate and potentially decrease the amount of time needed to pay off any debt. One of the greatest potential advantages of graduating one year earlier is the ability to start an exciting career path a year earlier. By finishing school early and entering the job market earlier, students have the potential to make more money each year, thus allowing them to save more and support their family sooner while leading a more comfortable financial life. \n\nFinally, an earlier graduation date also has the potential to give students more time to dedicate to their family. \nGraduating from high school in three years instead of the traditional four could be a game changer for students",

      "human_text": "So when we started to become closer friends my first impression of her changed because now i love her and the first impression of her didn't affect me after all.\n\nSo in conclusion , no , I don't think first impressions are almost hard to change. Also, when you first meet someone , typically you are nerves and you can be seen as a quiet and closed person when in reality you are really outgoing but it just takes you time to adapt to someone and many people don't act like themselfs.\n\nA example of why I disagree with \"first impressions being hard to change\" is because the first time I met my boyfriends mom I was really shy and nerves and I thought was giving off a bad vibe and making myself look \" bored \" even though I was just trying to be careful and not seem so crazy with what I said or did. After a while of me being around her she started to see me as a different person/much better person than i was and she started to see how outgoing I was and how I was nothing like the first impression I gave her and her view of me changed.\n\nAnother example I have of how first impression can be changed is the from the first time i met one of my best friends. Are first impressions impossible to change? No, I believe that first impressions are not impossible to change because when you typically meet someone for the first time many people just try to \" fit in \" or be someone who they really aren't but within time the perspective of how you are viewed can be changed and the first impression you made of yourself the first time won't matter. But it is also not something that can be changed within hours but with time the impression you give off can definitely be changed for the better or for the worse based on your actions as well.. I first met her through a mutual friend we both had and when we got introduced to each other i thought she was annoying and that she could never be serious but with the time that went by I started to see how she really was and that was her personality and maybe i judged to fast",

At first, I thought she was too judgemental and was wary of making friends with her. However, as I got to know her better, I began to appreciate her for her honest and direct personality. Everyone has had experiences where their first impression of someone has changed over time. For instance, when I first met my manager at work, I was unsure of how she would react to my ideas. Now, she is one of my closest friends.\n\nOverall, how someone's actions can affect their first impression cannot be denied. If we can take the time to get to know someone better, we may be able to look beyond their initial impressions and see the person they truly are.. She seemed distant and I was hesitant to voice my thoughts. \nFirst impressions are difficult to shake, but not impossible. I eventually learnt that her distant demeanor was only her way of being professional",

Online classes are greate! but for dome people don't think so, So my option are both some students benifets to do online or some doing it school. At online school your at home with your parents and siblings? ad have only one teacher that teaches you on the computer. Online its okay , but staying at home make me get lazy and too comfortable by staying home. For my own opinion , I think most students that have problems at school should take online or video classes at home to make it easier for them to learn and study.\n\nMost students that are special , speaks different language or problems could and should take online classes. Why? because its more better for me to learn from a teacher in person and see what they are do for me to learn. Even if you don't have problems you could take online classes if you wanted too.

For example, if a student is in his or her first year of high school and she or he wanted to be a doctor, but it realized that now he or she wants to be a teacher.

If they choose not to make it required than it will have their passing average higher than going low, and that the student can take the classes they want to take. Although some people say that taking drama, music or a art class is required, but I disagree because it's their choice to take those classes or not to take those classes.\n\nIf you think that those classes are required, then your wrong because, they won't do any classes that are forced them to take. If they are forced then they might like it when the class goes on, but if you say take the class or you won't pass then they will pass the class then just not doing anything.                                                                                                     .

Say one student who doesn't like art but he takes it and he goes on and become a popular artist, then people will think I should try those classes and see. Because say they want to go for other things after high school that doesn't need music, arts and drama then it was just a waste of their school time studying those, but not the one that you need for after high school. They will take it but they won't do anything in the class if they are forced to take what they doesn't like. I think school just have some class that are mandatory to take but elective aren't mandatory to take. So I think that those classes aren't required to take unless they want to take. Say, they did take the class because it was required but they fail, the passing average of that class will go from high to low because of it bring required.

Often, in order to make room for these subjects, students need to sacrifice other classes, such as math, science and language, which are essential for preparing students for college. \n\nIn conclusion, music, art, and drama classes should not be required for high school students. \n \nFurthermore, the benefit of enrolling in music, art, and drama classes is largely individual. \nHigh school students should not be required to take music, art, and drama classes because these subjects are often seen as secondary branches of a student's educational career. By not requiring these creative classes, students can dedicate more time to the core subjects that are necessary for succeeding in the long term",

Copying others does not help you learn anything other then getting your work completed.\n\nI think it is better working alone beacuse it would be better for me to learn. Also it's hard for others to communicate with others as a group which it also makes it better for anyone to work alone. Some people end up just copying off someone else to get stuff done. If you do struggle of course you can obvisouly ask a teacher or anyone for a hand in help because you could be stuck on something. You could do things your own way while working independently. Etheir working as a group or not you are still getting work done, and learning as you go. Yes, i'd probably take a long time getting it done just because I would be taking my time finding little details. All of the things I wrote about help show that it is better to work independently than with others in a group. Not everyone copies, nor cheats just alot of people such as students take working as a group an advantage to copy. If you did what you had to do alone without anybodys help besides the person who gave you the assignment, or job whatever than you done a good job just by doing your work independently.\n\nWorking as a group isn't bad I just suggest it should be better for students or anyone to work idependently also to learn what their doing instead of just getting it done when you can learn and get it done. Working together as a group can be much more easier than alone but still working independently is much more helpful for your learning benifits.\n\nAnyone who is not used to doing independent work gets a little kick on working alone because their so used to working as a group. Working idenpendently is harder than working as a group, but it's also better to learn things.                        . Some people choose not to work independently but I do. It helps people push them selves on finding more details, facts, and clues for what they need. You can focus more on your work while your alone because if your in a group working it gets you distracted. Others they actually do it and share with others who actually also have stuff done to share. If you hear other students or people talking to you, and the rest of the group giving each other ideas while your focued to find your own ideas gets you to unfocused.\n\nSomebody elses ideas in the group could be wrong, and when you write them and use those ideas you could be wrong as well. People usually rely on others to get answers which is not right. When I state that you can \"learn\" it means that you can find out things especially as a group where everyone has they're own ideas and facts about topics. Some people just take working as a group as an advantage to just copy and get answers just to get things done",

Additionally, the team members can take advantage of each other\u2019s skills to complete tasks better and faster than they would be able to do alone.. \nWorking independently and in a group both have their own advantages and disadvantages. The exchange of ideas within a group setting and the collaboration that takes place can lead to a more efficient outcome. However, in a group setting, learning can be enhanced due to the exchange of ideas and the faster completion of tasks.\n\nWhen it comes to productivity, working independently can be more efficient as there is less risk of distraction and peers getting lost on unrelated tasks. On the other hand, working in a group enables team members to communicate and discuss any discrepancies, which lead to more accurate solutions.\n\nUltimately, I believe that while both working independently and in a group can be effective, depending on one\u2019s goals and objectives, working in a group setting can prove to be more effective and productive. On the other hand, in group settings people can collaborate and provide each other with support that can lead to increased creativity and productivity.\n\nIn terms of communication and accuracy, working independently can lead to a more accurate and detailed work, as the individual has full control of what is being done and can give sharp attention to the specific details",

I think is a good, idea that students get different types of classes because that might help to choose their career. I think that thats why they should have many more classes that thats what its going to help them continue with their thinking of what career to choose once they gradute high school. Another confortable job is being a lowyer lowyers don't do much other than being in the computer or doing paperwork in that cause you dont have to be outside in the cold working on a bad job that involves working in a construction site. Its a really good idea knowing what you going to do with your life once you're done with high school.

To give you an example of what i am talking about is i had a friend name Generic_Name he was very hard working guy who was loved by everyone in the community. when Generic_Name get accepted to college he wanted to study biology but his mom wanted him study music but Generic_Name was never interested in music. Some say to be yourself is not the great accomplish but i disagree with that because being yourself, not losing hope, not giving up, and fighting with others trying not to be something that they are make you to be is the greatest accomplishment. No one should every try to make you something that you are not. But Generic_Name's family didn't understand that all they care about was her getting in medical school and be a doctor. he want to learn about living and nonliving things, but Generic_Name's mom never agree with him she told him\" you have to study music and that's that.\" Generic_Name was my best so when he told me about his problem i told him\" Listen Generic_Name i know you love your mom so much, but do what you love to do will make you happy and you don't have to be something that you are not interested in because you will suffer in the future\". Generic_Name was born in single family he was living with his mom and two younger brother. We all know that being a doctor is not an easy job. I remember a very good friend of mine name Generic_Name, wanted to be an artiste, but every one in her family wanted her to be a doctor. Always stay strong and never give up.\n\n\"To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.\" According to me every person in this world have the right to speak their mind and do whatever they wish or desire. The lesson to learn in this story is to never give up your dreams for your loved ones because once you started doing something there is no way back.\n\nIn the future knowing that you did something for yourself and knowing that no matter what other said you did what you love to do is the greatest accomplishment that you could ever accomplish. sure you get high salary but being a doctor is not about getting high salary or wearing the white uniform is about carrying for others and enjoying your time with others . I was under so much pressure, stress, and anxiety that i thought i was in a war with my own family. I remember a time where i was under so much stress and pressure because my parents wanted me to be this perfect, wonderful, and hard working person just so i could be the best torture.\n\nDo you remember a time where you wanted to do something so bad, but everyone else wanted you to do something that you don't even like and want. The lesson that we could learn from my story is not to stand against your family and disrespected, them, but no to allow anyone to take your dream away from you. Everything i said or do they use it against me it was very sad, angry, depressed, and unhappy moments, but i get though it i did become a dancer, i did something that i thought i could never do, and i didn't let anyone to shut me down with their words or actions. One example of that is when i was little i always dreamed of becoming the greatest dancer at all time, but everyone was against what i wanted to do. Generic_Name loved his mom so much he didn't want to make her sad so we he went to college and he study music, but he never like what he was doing because he was born to be a biologist. Everyone has the right to be happy in their lives and we should accepted them they way they are. Generic_Name is very smart, carrying, and wonderful person. Generic_Name's mom was a wonderful women who was loves by everyone. i remember i had to set down and have word with my family i had to explain to them why i want to be what i want to be. In today's world we people try to make changes in others life by trying to make them something that they are not and that's where we lost loves one, friends and family just because we choice to do things we wanted insisted taking their advice and changing our path. Do you remember a time where whether it was your parents, teacher, or someone very close to you excepts you to be something that you are not? According to me, every parents wants their kids to be perfect, wonderful, and hard working. That's why we should never pressure someone to be something that they are not.\n\ndreaming and working hard to be something that you always dreamed of is very hard when you have people, who constantly try to make something out of you that you know that you are not. because of her family pressure her to be a doctor she let her dream go and now is suffering very much, because she doesn't want to be a doctor she wants to be an artiste something that she wanted to do her whole lives. Generic_Name was the older child so he had a lot of responabilty he had to work to provide for his family, he had to go to school, and take care of his younger brothers'.

People who become independent by being themselves reflect their own authentic values and beliefs in their decisions, allowing them to become more confident and in control of their destiny.\n\nThe advantages of being true to yourself and remaining independent in this way can be seen in areas such as career decisions, financial decisions, and relationships. Likewise, depending on someone else can have both positive and negative repercussions. On one hand, it can provide a strong support system of guidance and perspective, but on the other hand, it can create an environment of constraints and \u2018shoulds\u2019.\n\nFor example, Caitlyn decided to become independent by pursuing a career in web development. However, depending on someone else can also provide guidance and support if used correctly. On the other hand, Mary was encouraged by her family to pursue a degree in Biology, but not for her own enjoyment or interests. \nBeing independent is a way for people to be unshackled from the expectations and opinions of other people and step out from the shadows of society. Here, the lack of independence meant that Mary felt pressured to make a decision which wasn\u2019t right for her, consequently leading to her dropping out of school.\n\nIn conclusion, becoming independent by being yourself can have a positive impact on personal decisions, bringing about more confidence and allowing you to make better choices which reflect your own values and beliefs. Independent individuals have the freedom to make decisions which will directly affect the life they are leading, without any external pressure from other people or society",

But he tried again and again and he never gave up and now he is one of the most famous journalists in Morocco without any experience and still better then the one that do have experiences.\n\nFirst of all ,an employee doesn't need experience to find a job , he just need to be loyal to his job and work hard and be such an honest person to make his work go even higher and help spread love and respect at his job to all the people .\n\nSecond , it's not necessarily that it has to do with jobs obviously ; it can be acting or sports or anything you want to do .You don't certainly need to have experience to do it just like Mohamed Ali said :'Everyone start out as a beginner \", but in term of jobs you just have to show your employers how much you deserve this job and that you can be a better candidate to hire . For me , experience have nothing to do with jobs everything depends on the work you're going to do and not the work you have done , and I'm pretty sure that the persons with no experience will rock it more than the ones that do have experiences and just keep in your mind the positive energy and you'll make it just like my father did and my french friend did .. My father told me that mostly the workers that don't have experiences are the ones that work hard and always bring ideas that push the job even higher and they usually have positive attitude and a positive vibe that makes the boss love them more then the other employees.\n\nThird, I don't know why all these employers don't give a chance to the employees just to see what they can do , there's a lot of people that didn't even got a chance to show their work , even thought they can be the best at it .I have a french friend that wanted to be a teacher assistant for a french class here in the United States of America , but all the schools didn't accept her as a teacher because she didn't had much experience in teaching and that is just not fair .She is french and she can teach better because she is from the country where the language is coming from and that's how the students will learn pretty easily , that's why I believe that the employers should change their opinion about the experiences.\n\nFinally , It really doesn't matter if you don't have experiences because if you believe in your self it means that you can get any job you want , just keep the hard work and all these employers that still think that experience is necessary will regret it after because they will see you at the top . My father didn't found a job too and he is mom was sick and he had me as his son so young . A lot of a good workers are doing all their best to find new jobs and a believing future for themselves , most of them are responsible and confident that they can do anything to make the work up and even more better than it before , but they usually don't find it because they don't have experiences and these employers don't want to hire them just because of that .\n\nAlthough, a lot of people may argue that employees may need experience to find jobs but actually none of that is right .There's a lot of people that found jobs and succeed without experience , you just have to keep believing and never give up. But you need to prepare for it thought because you don't want to look like a person that can not bring the job up and that you don't know anything about it",

However, there are many cases in which individuals have been hired and have achieved success without any prior job experience. This means that an employer may not need to worry about skills gaps that would need to be filled with a more experienced hire. \n\nSecondly, potential employers often look for people who have fresh perspectives that could potentially add value to their team. There are a variety of digital certifications and classes available online that can help new hires to gain skills and knowledge that can be used towards the job at hand. \nThere is an often-misheld belief that employees must possess experience in order to obtain a job and succeed. For a company, taking a risk and hiring a novice can be a great way to foster an innovative culture that brings value.\n\nFinally, employers may consider a potential employee who has leadership or volunteer work experience instead of job experience. There are a few key reasons why this is the case.\n\nFirst of all, having on-the-job training can often be an equally valuable asset to a potential employer as experience itself",

Doing any that situation on not regular time of school will deacrese the sturent missing on any period of class.\n\nWithout forget the teacher's situations who are the parents at the same time and need one extra day for family time and doing regular acctivities with their sons if that they have.\n\nDon't forget the situations on seniors who are the most difficult situations on their life, decide for future, and they need time for keeping all option from universities and college for do the next step, higher education nad considered also job for weekends, also about freshman, who are the chlidren from middle school, they are the situation on needing understanding from extra activities on high school changed from their last rutine.\n\nAnother opctions for Friday or Monday free day can be used for community service, with permition of parent and some supervision of some adults, any students who wants participate on this can go and help on cleaning up street and river or any help on relation with community service, also the schools can create any program that consist on get many big companies who wants help students find a job on this new free day and may be part-time on weekend.\n\nConsidering:\n\nOnly four-day school, forget about the fifth day on school (No coming a little time for five days use the full time on four days)\n\nthree free days per week (use this extra time on family or friends meeting, any thing you and your parents want)\n\nNo wake up on Friday mornings or may be Monday mornings (dependes on the detition of the school about which day is going to be the third free day, use time for rest and complete responsabilities)\n\nThis idea can be not convenient for students with part-time job, because by following this model by extending the school day two hour will decrease the student's time sheet, even though if every one on this situation can use the fifth school day that will be free for a full-time job and get three full-time job.\n\nAlways remain.

      "ai_text": "\nRecent studies have proposed that shorter school weeks may provide benefits to students, parents, and teachers alike. Due to the longer school days, school times may need to be adjusted to accommodate longer hours, leading to impacts on transportation and after-school activities. This additional day for learning could potentially minimize the impacts of longer school days, while opening up additional opportunities for students to enhance their skills. Nevertheless, further research is needed to determine the implications of the switch for those involved.. Furthermore, students may benefit from the extra days off from school for additional extracurricular activities and for more family time. Educators may also find more time to plan quality lessons and have additional days for professional development. The most popular of these proposals is the four-day school week. In addition, providing additional options for transportation and school programs can help to address potential impacts on poor and special-needs students.\n\nUltimately, a four-day school week has the potential to significantly impact the educational experience of students, teachers, and parents. Proponents argue that the extra days outside of school can allow for more quality learning opportunities, while detractors argue that the move would create too much disruption to their schedules. Advantages of the four-day school week include the potential to save money on bussing, electricity, and other operational costs. Also, the switch may adversely affect poor and special-needs students who rely on regular school schedules.\n\nOne potential solution to some of the potential disadvantages of a four-day school week is implementing additional academic enrichment activities on the fifth day of the week. \n\nHowever, a four-day school week is also not without its drawbacks",

My first day of school i was afraid to not make any friends because i'm not a social person, but them i become friends with a girl name Generic_Name because of a project i was doing with her, and since that day i'm still friends with her.\n\nOne of the reasons why people like to work in groups is because a lot of people are really nice in many ways. but one day i was sad and mad at someone about something they said, but that day i was working in a project with some people and they started to be nice to me and make me laugh so my day can get better so the reason here is that working in groups can be a lot of beneficial because that day it was a really busy day at my job but because of the people on the group i was working with, they made my bad day to a good day.\n\nWorking in groups is a lot more beneficial than working alone because people can get things done more faster, make new friends, and more fun. Also students would be able to know how to work in groups in their future job, to make friends, to become more independent, and to be nice. people can get things more faster, and more good because more people more ideas. working with other people would get people to know how other people feel and to get to know more people to become friends. working in groups is a better idea than working alone because when people work in groups they get more social and to be able to know and to conjugate with other people. Many people choose to work alone because it more quiet, the grade they get on the activity only affect themselves and not other people, and not distracted from other people around them. Getting things more faster is beneficial, teachers can give students extra credit in their activity or project. . There is two ways of working at school, one is to work alone another is to work in groups. in one occasion when i came to the united states i was at school and that day our teacher told us that we have to do a project and she gave us the option to work alone or to work in groups, so in that time i was a little scared and afraid to talk to people since i didn't know any English and i also was scared of people to not be able to understand me because i did not know any English i knew some words but not a lot, but a girl name Generic_Name came to ask me if i wanted to work with her and her friend, and i said yes, it was a lot of help working with them because i didn't understand anything the teacher asked us to do and what the project was about but they help me a lot to understand everything and to learn a little more English and to develop my self.\n\nWorking with other people it more easy than working by yourself. but i prefer working in groups to be with friends, get things done more faster, and more fun.\n\nWorking in groups is a advantage because the people on your group can help you in many ways like to know something you dont understand, or when you need help they can help you in what you are straggling in. i really hope our teachers can give us more opportunities to work in groups than to work and do everything alone because it really help a lot of people to become social and more independent and to develop themselves",

Part of growing in this life is having the right type of mindset and skill you want for yourself only. We would sell them and flip the money beacuse we'd be the ones fixing them up a bit. I myself bought the motor for a thousand and installed the whole thing by myself but yet with the right tools it was then worth five thousand because of how many miles the engine was and how clean the interior and exterior was. I'd love to race and compete against other peoples builds for money on the track. I like to build and take apart engines or even add parts to get more potential out of any car I purchase. That type of skill has helped me so much in life because it has always helped me make the right decsions when I am driving on the road even in school it has helped me remember and react a little faster then others in class. The best part of mastering this skill is that I will never need a mechanic to fix my own car again.\n\nAnother skill I have become really good at is gaming and playing the fracnchise called Call of duty. I love to race cars and also flip my money too. The human brain is mean't to be expanded and stretched like a muscle to learn new things like playing a sport , remembering equations in physics and solving over and over again and still getting logical answers , to be good at something takes practice , but to master whatever you want to master takes brilliance. These types of games are shooter games and it all depends on how fast your sensitivity is and how fast you can react to whatever is happening in the game. Through this I've mastered to actually get through everday life without having such stress because I am always prepared to react and decide what is good for me.\n\nAll in all I agree with Ralph Waldo he is right without trying something new you won't grow at all. Some people like the entertainment but more like to see how fast the reactions I have. I would always becareful though when it came to turbo the engines. This skill improves everyday because it's affected my everyday life. . The things I have learned in today's day is probably not really achievable because people give up to easy and think it's hard to fix cars. That all takes skill but you don't learn if your not taught in life.\n\nLikewise myself , for 11 years my father taught me how to use his tools and fix little things on any car he had at the moment. When I got my very first car it had no motor in it and bought it for six hundred dollars. When it comes to gaming I like to post videos online of how good I am because I can also get paid through how many people watch my videos",

Students should enjoy summer break, cause they would not have to worry about school and they can get to relax some educators should not complain about summer break being too long cause having a long break is better than to go to school cause school you have to do work and do tests. for spring break should always be in March not in April cause it has always been spring break in March spring break should be 2 weeks to take a break from school and to come back in school with a fresh mind to get ready to go to school and learn. from last year when they come back to school is not true cause some people remember what they learned last year and some don't and i don't think summer break should be 3 to 4 weeks cause most of time students are in school more than they get to have a long break. so the students can be prepared the only break in fall is thankgiving which is only a week that seems fair cause is just the 2nd holiday in November having breaks is always a good thing i don't know why some people hate it it gets you time to think about things it helps people a lot to relive stress on people it makes people happy and puts a smile on people's faces and that is all i have to say about all the breaks for the seasons. but in during the summer break you get to relax all day summer is the time to hangout with your friends and famiy and to go to vacation to enjoy life too and not think about school or work that is what summer is all about and for educators saying that students are not going to remember what they learned in school. cause that is the most important things in school i think for winter break has to be 2 weeks cause of chrimstmas and new years that time is too enjoy those 2 holidays with your family and then come back to school in january.

This time helps students to relax and come back to school feeling refreshed, enabling them to tackle their studies with renewed enthusiasm.\n\nDuring summer holidays, students can benefit from being exposed to new experiences, which can also encourage learnings outside the classroom and school walls. For example, summers provide a great opportunity to travel \u2014 allowing students to explore different cultures and expand their horizons. Extended summer holidays give students a much-needed break from the pressures of school and allow them to recuperate mentally. At home, students can dedicate time to reading books, working on creative projects, learning music or sports, and more. Short breaks for the rest of the year provide mini breaks throughout the school year, which can be just as beneficial as longer breaks. Therefore, it is extremely useful for educational institutions to have extended periods of summer break and shorter breaks for the rest of the year.. While shorter breaks may seem more manageable for educational institutions to plan, it\u2019s always been argued that having extended periods of summer break is important for students.\n\nFirstly, the schoolwork that many students have to do can be overwhelming. \nSchools around the world differ in how long they break for summer. In many places, the summer holidays can last anywhere from 6-10 weeks, while for the rest of the year, there are short breaks lasting around 1-3 weeks. This can be done without any rush or worry, allowing students to take the time they need to work on their projects.\n\nOverall, summer breaks allow students to take necessary time off from the academic rigor and can accelerate learning in the following year when students are able to tackle their studies with renewed motivation and perspective",

Sometimes student don't like the teacher for some reasons and they will prefer to not ask the teacher for help. It is clear for me i would work with a group than working alone.. Students may feel more comfortable asking their class mates and not the teacher. They can help you understand and explain it to you more how they understand it. It was actually very helpful and successful. Because they are not very comfortable with the teacher.\n\nFinal, that was my opinion on the benefits of working with a group or working alone. Think about the benefits of working with group or alone. It is way better than working alone. Working in a group it's more easy to do the class assignment and take less time. Well for me working with group is better. It's always nice meeting new people and getting to know them. You can work on class assignment with your group. You are doing an class activity it's more fun if you work with a group. I enjoy working with friends because we can talk about other things to and get to know more people. If you are working alone on an activity and you feel it is boring. And i actually like working in group because it's fun. Some students rather ask their friends for help. We started talking about it and help each other understanding it. Sometimes students don't really understand the teacher very well. For me i can work with the any group and without distracting the other people in the class. And if you don't know what to do because you were not paying attention you group should know and tell you what you need to do.\n\nAnother reason, why working with someone's else it's better. You can work faster and better with a group on an activity. They will try to make you understand if they can. Just because of the way she or he teaches. Everyone in the group was able to understand the new topic. You can ask them to help you if you are struggling. Group working is so much better than working alone.\n\nWorking in a group is great because they can help you out. And if they are from different country or different culture. They can tell you the wrong and help you correct it.\n\nThe second, reason why working in group is better. You might take a lot of time to finish because it is boring",

This saves time and allows members to focus on what they're best at, which can result in better work in less time.\n\nThe communal aspect of collaboration promotes a deeper understanding of the task. Group members can bounce ideas off each other, hearing multiple perspectives and honing their understanding. \n\nWorking together also improves relationships between group members. This is especially true for more complex projects, as several views help to bring a clearer understanding to the topic. Productivity can be increased, understanding can be deepened, and relationships can be strengthened. It encourages communication, developing trust and strengthening bonds.

You can ride along easy trails in the city for a leisurely ride or conquer more challenging terrain outside the city. Camping is a great way to get away and reconnect with nature while enjoying quality time with your loved ones. Plus, bikes are relatively low-cost and environmentally friendly.. The main advantage of camping is that it's a relatively low-cost activity that anyone can do regardless of age. You can camp in the backyard, go on weekend trips to nearby camping spots, or even take extended trips to explore new terrain",

A career is something you have to think before you get in to an specific career because later on you might want to change the career your in right now. It is a case of kids that take things seriously not all kids take everything serious and talking about school and careers that is a problem. In high school a lot of kids change and not for good they make bad decision and totally forget why they go to school for. Students should be able to really think about what they like and what interest them about a career before having just get in to it. You be able to like the career you chose because if not you will not enjoy being in the career. They go to school to create a future for themselves to be able to have a better life not all kids think like that until something wrong happens. If they do not pay attention or take it serious they will not succeed in the career as well in life because they will not be able to get a good job. If we did not have schools that give you the opportunity to study a career I wonder where would we be would we have good jobs that pays good enough money.\n\nIn conclusion, I do not think is a good Idea for students should commit to a career in at a young age. In most situations kids change there minds and decide that the career they got in to does not favor them and they want to change the career. Kids that are still young do not really think about careers or what they can do with the career they study. Should enjoy the career you pick because it gives you passion and strength to keep getting up from bed and get ready to go to school to study that career.\n\nFinally some students at a young age that are just about to enter high school do not pay enough attention to school or the career they are studying. Some students in high school do not really think about it, but the reason why they go to school to better there lives in the future. That means that they do not want a better life or to better themselves they do not want the help. Students that are just to enter high school do not really know how hard they are going to have to work to be good in the career they would have selected.\n\nFirst students do not really know what they have a passion for, they should not have to commit to a career they do not know if they are going to like after awhile in the career. Also students should not have to be forced to be in a career they do not like thats why they should have time to think on what they like and what they do not like.\n\nNext students are still young to know what career to get in to they should be forced to figure it out so quickly they should get more time to really think on it. At a young age kids do not really have a clue on what they really like or have an interest career wise. A career is something to take serious because in the future that would be where you will be working and if you do not like that will not be a pleasant job to work at. We do not really know what we really like until like the end of the year of high school I believe because at that time we are more matured. In addition they are young they do not know what is to have such a big responsibility.              . I believe that students should not have to commit to a career at a young age because they will not take the career serious they will take it as a joke",
      "ai_text": "Moreover, waiting to commit to a path until later in high school can save students from investing in unsuccessful or inappropriate study practices. Taking time to explore available career options, form study habits, and seek guidance from mentors can help students to select an appropriate career track as they enter adulthood. The high school years are a critical time for developing knowledge and skills that can impact long-term career success. Ineffective studying practices can lead to failure in a chosen career, but taking the time to research thoroughly and develop effective methods will provide a strong foundation for long-term success.. \nWhen it comes to making an informed commitment to a career, it is important to recognize the value of waiting until later in high school",

I agree with his statement and believe it as true, as most people look up to and copy whoever is currently popular on social media. Much like a pack of wolves, the leader sets an example and rest follow it.\n\nIt could be argued that a speech or something of the sort could also influence people, such as Martin Luther King Jr's \"I Have A Dream\" speech. People also like to follow the example of what they are taught, by parents or teachers. A person cant do something they were never taught or ever learned, so they look to other people who can do things; and look up to them. Only by setting an example can others follow. Most of the time, people would not do something without being influenced or persuaded by someone else. For example: if you like food and you watch someone cook, it could possibly persuade you into making your own food. In this essay, i'll be talking about how setting an example for others is the best way to influence others into doing something.\n\nFirst of all, Watching someone do something that interests you could influence you into doing the same. Albert Schweitzer, a philosopher said, \"Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing\". By setting examples, people are influenced into doing all sorts of things. Otherwise, why would kids be doing these \"Challenges\" that you hear on the news every other day?\n\nIn conclusion, Examples are the best and most effective way to influence others into doing things. Take Juuling for example, most kids would never do such a thing unless being persuaded or peer pressured by their friends.\n\nSecondly, Teaching someone to do good by an example is also good, as it sets them down a good path, just as most parents do. Whether they are good or bad is completely subjective and depends on what the person is influenced into doing. A single persons actions can change how other people act",
      "ai_text": " Similarly,  popular  online  challenges  have  been  effective  at  influencing  younger  generations  and  can  be  a  powerful  form  of  setting  an  example.\n\nDrawing from theories in evolutionary psychology, there are parallels to setting an example and how animals such as wolves act in a pack.  This  trend  has  swept  classrooms  and  has  made  e-cigarettes  seem  like  the  norm;  in  studies,  researchers  have  found  the  direct  correlation  between  seeing  peers  use  e-cigarettes  and  developing  the  habit  oneself. Examples can be very persuasive and prove that such behavior is possible. \nSetting  an  example  is  an  effective  way  to  influence  those  around  us. A pack of wolves often looks to one or two members to set an example and guide them. In the same vein, setting an example can be a powerful force for cognitive growth and social change. This is because individuals are more likely to assimilate into the groups and adopt behaviors seen from those in the same social setting. Whether it be through trends such as \u201cJuuling\u201d or through setting a standard of excellence, setting an example can be an impactful way to shape the thoughts, beliefs, and behaviors of those around us.. Furthermore, when those around us set examples of excellence, it often improves the quality of the entire group by pushing one another ever higher.\n\nIn conclusion, setting an example is an effective way to gain influence within modern day society. \n\nSetting an example is the best method of influencing individuals.  For  example,  the  recent  phenomenon  of  \u201cJuuling\u201d  has  demonstrated  the  power  of  setting  an  example",

      "human_text": "If the principal did do this then a huge weight is lifted off their shoulders.\n\nJumping to my next conclusion if a extra activity is required then this can cause stress and anxiety for students who dont want to be there. I mean who would want to be forced into working on the yearbook or playing soccer yea absolutely no one. This can cause of lack of thinking process, failure in grades and bad attitude.\n\nLet me explain. Generic_Name\n\nYour principal has decided that all students must participate in a least one extracurricular activity. Besides if a student was forced to participate in an program what activity's would they have. Now it would make sense if the principal had a democrative system where the school voted for this option but thats not the case in however that is what the principal should do and the principal should ask the school to vote to get rid of the requirement or keep this way this can give the students, the principal and staff more reassurance. Imagine a boy who just moved in from a different state. Now put yourself in that students shoes how would you feel in his situation.\n\nMost Students just want to get through the day, get home and relax. Students want to be free. what if he/she doesn't like sports or working on the year book or etc. How does it benefit the student in any way.\n\nStudents should have a right to decide whether or not they want to join a club or activity. Only later to realize that it is a requirement to sign up for a \"extracurricular activity.\" Although the boy does not want to sign up for an activity because he does not know anyone. Now my parents would start to be disappointed in me and i would start building up anxiety. That anxiety if built up enough would most likely lead to depression and worse case scenario suicidal thoughts.\n\nSo in conclusion it is a bad idea to require a extracurricular activity.\n\nInstead of forcing it i would heavily recommend choosing a activity because you never know how someone feels about certain things.. Thats why its wrong for the principal to make this decision. Now he has to transferred to the nearest school, having to start anew. I assume it is because the principal does not want there to be empty clubs/programs and that makes sense but it isn't fair to the students who do not want to be apart of any activities. myself for example. The boy had a lot of amazing, awesome friends that he had to leave behind. Nobody wants to be forced into doing anything in life. If I was in a extra elective and I was forced to be in and i didn't like it I would start to stress then my grades in that class would start to fail, then slowly my grades in other classes would also fail. The reasoning for this is because, if a student does not like any of the programs then it wouldn't be fair if he/she still had to choose one. However, by adding this system the principal is adding a whole other level of stress for these students. For example, students could participate in sports,work on the yearbook, or serve on the student council.\n\nWould Students want to be forced into taking a program, club, or after school activity, no, of course not. Except with a required activity they have a whole other class to worry about and making sure that class has good grades especially if that student dislikes being there.\n\nIt needs to be a choice whether or not a student wants to select a \"extracurricular activity\".\n\nI can see a probable reason the principal made this choice. His parents gave him the election forms and he has signed up for everything he needs",
      "ai_text": "Additionally, students may be pushed to participate in an extracurricular activity which they have no genuine interest in, ultimately leading to disinterest and disengagement. On one hand, extracurricular activities can give students the opportunity to explore their interests and develop valuable skills that will benefit them in the future. \n\nHowever, it is also important to take into account the potential drawbacks of such a requirement. \n\nIn conclusion, mandating extracurricular activities could potentially offer students a range of benefits. \nThe introduction of a new school requirement that all students must participate in an extracurricular activity has far-reaching implications, both positive and negative. This can lead to frustration and a feeling that there is simply not enough time or resources to devote to the extracurricular activity. Enforcing the mandate can put an additional strain on students already faced with a skyrocketing workload. Moreover, it encourages students to form meaningful relationships with their peers, resulting in enhanced social and emotional growth. On the other hand, the mandate may place additional burden on already stressed and overbooked students, ultimately leading to feelings of resentment and disengagement. By making extracurricular activities mandatory, students are given the opportunity to try something new and develop a passion that could eventually form the basis of a future career. In this essay, I will explore the effects of a school requirement that all students must participate in an extracurricular activity.\n\nThe primary benefit of the mandate is increased engagement and motivation among students. Yet, it is also important to consider the potential drawbacks and to ensure that all students have the resources and support they need to succeed.",

Manager, I heard that you are selecting students to give them the opportunity to work in your company to gain experience, and to see if that job interests them. Furthermore, I can say that having skill and talent can give us more motivation and helps us improve more everyday.\n\nIn conclusion, I can say that getting involve in such programs and company jobs helps students to choose their career and gives them the opportunity to see if they really want that job or are they ready for the career that they are dreaming for. Last year she got the chance to work with Generic_City Biology and Science department. After a while she gives up and didn't continue to her job anymore.

When technology was first introduced many people didnt know how it could be used to help save lives or help build buldings,schools,malls everything that we have today is because of how benefical technology is to us. In conclusion technology can be very helpful or in some ways bad for peoples lives i think that technology no matter what will just get better and help many other just like it has helped me. Technology has come a long way from its past and it continues to progress and evolve every year we move up as we continue to progress the future might be filled with just technology.\n\nThe way i use technology are in many different ways i put a alarm to wake me up i also use my computer when im doing home work or projects that i need to finish its also useful when im stuck or dont know what something means so i use my phone and search it up online to find the meaning of a word or subject. In contrast humans also have a choice to check out books,shop and play games without human contact. Many people still go out and shop in stores many also enjoy going to the libary to check out books even though we can't go to blockbuster and check out movies anymore we can always go watch one in a movie theater. First of all technology has helped people in many ways to do various sort of things when people are in need of something. For example in hospitals technology evolves every year so that when people come in very sick it helps them by detetecting what they have or whats going on with a accurate solution.\n\nHowever people may say that technology has negative effects on people because it removes there social skills and the way people interact with each other because in older generations there was a lack of technology and people would communicate with others when they were in need of something. In my opinion i think its very helpful and positive to my life it has helped me in many ways and it gets me through also in school activities i dont think it has impacted me to a negative side because going to go play soccer or doing something else has not stop me from socializing with others around me",
      "ai_text": "Despite these advantages, the rampant use of technology can also promote distraction among students due to its availability and ease of access.\n\nIn terms of leisure activities, technology has been a great asset when it comes to entertainment and leisure. For instance, apps like Headspace provide guided meditation exercises and educational resources that help improve mental health. \n\nBased on my experiences, I believe that overall, the use of technology has had a mostly positive impact on people. It has allowed us to access vast amounts of knowledge and each other through various online platforms, such as Coursera and Skype, while offering a variety of multimedia tools to facilitate the learning process. On the flip side, however, it has diminished face-to-face interactions since many of us spend our free time in front of our screens rather than physically engaging with each other.\n\nWhen it comes to health, technology can be a source of both mental and physical benefits. \nHaving grown up in the age of technology, I have personally experienced both the benefits and drawbacks of its use in my day-to-day life. Despite the potential it has to open new doors, it can also leave people feeling isolated when they become too dependent on technology.\n\nPersonally, I use technology on a daily basis as a part of both my work and leisure activities. From streaming music or playing video games to exercising via fitness apps, technology can connect people and opens up possibilities for new creative experiences. On the other hand, there are a variety of health risks associated with technology such as frequent headaches and excessive strain on the neck and shoulders due to the lack of posture.\n\nTechnology has also revolutionized the way we learn and conduct our educational studies. I use it to search for information on the internet for my school assignments, communicate and stay connected with my friends, stream music, and play video games.

I also want to point out If students are trying to get more homework done,the less sleep they're getting and If kids come to school the next day,they won't get the information they need for their classes because they're tired.\n\nStudents will start to fail in school because of no sleep and this time in won't be there fault for their sleep management. This time it will be the school boards fault for adding stress to these children and why they're not getting enough sleep. I hope the school boards read this and take time to considerate this idea that would just give another reason for students to fail in the future.. If the less time students are home,the less time they have to complete homework or assignments. No,I don't think the school board should add a extra hour to school each day. My reasoning is because If you put this in a students perspective,they have to wake up 5 or 6 am in the morning to get ready for school,stay there for 9 hours and come home to do homework.\n\nYou can't even imagine coming home a hour and a half later trying to get homework done. I'm not saying it's impossible for student to come home an hour and a half late and still get their sleep,but If they have homework and they spend there day focused on it it's likely students won't get good sleep",

Many students already feel overwhelmed with a full day of classes and after-school activities, and such a lengthy school day would only exacerbate that feeling. Between homework time, extracurriculars, and sleep, something would inevitably have to be cut from the equation and most likely it would be needed sleep. For instance, school boards could consider offering extra periods, or \u201cmodules,\u201d throughout the year, outside of the traditional school day, to give students the opportunity to focus on their studies. \nAdding an extra hour and a half to the school day could have a drastic impact on students\u2019 ability to complete homework and get enough sleep.

The parties they go to are sometimes on weekdays and it ends around 2-3 in the morning which is way past the curfew. It is best for teenagers to stay home after curfew and get a good night sleep.\n\nNow days teenagers don't spent so much time with their parents. usually, curfew keeps teenagers out of trouble because, if there was no curfew teens would stay out late, do illeagel stuff ,and get them self in deep trouble.\n\nTeenagers would be in trouble and also in danger if they don't follow the curfew. The curfew is there for the protection of the teenagers.. Especially, teenagers now days get more in trouble late at night because they do illeagal things. There has been a lot of kidnapings and sex trafficking happening in the United states it is best for teenagers to stay home past curfew.

Teens tend to go to parties a lot and they drink under age which can get them in trouble with the law and also it is bad for their health. The curfew could help their parents spend some extra time with their kids. If the teens come home that late at night they wont be able to get proper sleep because, they have school so getting less than 5 hours of sleep is not good for teenagers health at all. In the modern times kids want to stay out late until 2-3 in the morning, but it is not safe for kids to be staying out that late. If the teenagers wants to hangout past curfew they can always go to their friends house or their friends could come to their house with their parents permission and they can hangout and be safe at the same time. Usually, most teens don't have a license so they would uber their way to wherever their destination is and ubering at night is dangerous because, teens can get kidnap or anything bad can happen to them, so that staying out after curfew could get teens in trouble and in danger.\n\nIf teenagers start to stay out after the curfew technically they would be breaking the law.

Furthermore, by helping to reduce the risk of illegal and unsafe activities, the city can benefit from having a curfew in place.. It can help enforce healthy bedtimes and routines, and reduce the risk of teens engaging in dangerous activities. \nResearch has shown that when teenagers do not follow curfew, the consequences can be severe. Having a curfew can help teens prioritize important tasks and activities like completing homework and chores, as well as spending time with friends and family. Furthermore, teens who stay out late into the night are at an increased risk for developing mental and physical health problems due to poor sleep or irregular sleep patterns.\n\nImplementing a curfew can help keep teens from troulbe by helping them establish healthy and realistic routines.

Eugenio has been proving us that dreams can come true. As you should do!\n\nIn conclusion, in order to success we have to go from failure to failure. Oprah had suffer a lot since she was a child; yet she decided to continue with her life. Yet everybody else was saying that she would not be able to accomplish what she wanted; instead of supporting her they were feeling sorry for her, and not doing anything. Therefore, she became more stronger than she had ever been, and now she is showing as that even after everything she has been through you can smile with placer and success.\n\nOn the other hand we have immigrants; those people who fight day by day to get no even what they want, but what they need. As a matter of facts; Failure help us to become who we really want to be or who we are suppose to be, but no all of us get the chance to feel successful or not even see any progress; yet some people choose to give up, instead of fight for a better life; A life with success. As I was said before; there are so many people that have been showing us that everything is possible. By fighting this battles day by day we are not just creating a better country for ourselves, but a better country for our families. Yet everybody was judging me, I decided to teach myself how do become a better version of me. Therefore, we have to think about the future that we want and start working on it, so we can be the people we want to be; the people our parents want us to be. Also, I always wanted to show everyone that they were wrong about me that I am capable as everyone else. I will continue fighting for myself. Remember that hard battles make hard soldiers. Instead of been afraid for our mistakes we need to learn from them, so we can success in our life. Somehow my family does not have faith in me; and even though that if I fail I have no one to support me; I am afraid. Eugenio Dervez is an example of overcoming in a different country, language, and culture. Even though it was not easy to act like nothing happened, but she knew what king of person she wanted to be. But do we loss enthusiasm during our way to success? yes we do!\n\nIt is OK to loss enthusiasm in our way to success; that is showing every body else, and you as well that we are humans, and we can get tire sometimes; But what is not OK is to give up, because you will showing everybody that you are weak.\n\nBy showing us how difficult life can get, and tough us that you are the only one who choose to continue or to give up in your life; Oprah Winfred would be a great overcoming example. Oprah was a determinate woman; a woman who wanted to be successful. Do not doubt that the sky is the limit even for the suffering. Some people say that hard things make hard soldiers; Therefore, failure is part of the success, but that does not make it easy for us; Why? Because no one likes the idea of suffer in order to be successful in life.                                                                                                              . Even though some people could be selfish even in your own family; Instead of been worry about others opinion worry about your future; so one day you can be successful, too.\n\nFinally, in my experience I have fail so many times; but I am sure that any of those times I have fail will not stop me from what I want to do or who I want to be.

Also, it helps student to learn how to communicate with other team member because team work is very important and necessary to learn before students start working professionally.\n\nI believe that working in group will gives student more ideas and everyone in group can share their thoughts with each other. Working with group is more beneficial because, if a person work in group then he/she can share thought and ideas before start working. Group working is also save time because everyone work together rather then only one person has burden to complete all work.\n\nTo conclude, I just want to mention that I understand that working alone is more beneficial for some people but, working in group is much better more easier than working alone",

Most kids think that its not neccesary for the school cafeteria to change the menu but in reality most kids don't eat at school due the type of food they serve. My parents especially my mom would barely have time to make me something, for example, she didnt have time to make me a snack or something real quick so I could have taken it to school when I was in elementary school, she would always tell me that she did'nt have time that she was always in a rush and thats why sometimes I would'nt eat. In my honest opinion i think that they should shange the menu because when I dont well or i dont eat at all it is hard for me to concentrate in class and that is a huge priority to pay attention in class and try to get good grades. When I was younger I would'nt eat at school and until this day I don't because i didnt like and i would always have somach aches, and my head would hurt a lot, and i wasent able to concentrate in class. I believe that changing the schools lunch menu and making it healthier is a good idea because kids would enjoy the food, parents would not conplain about their kids not eating in schhol, and it would be a great advantage to improve the school lunch.\n\nMost kids think that the school lunch is not very appetizing, but if the school cafeteria decides to change the school menu it would make a huge difference beacuse I know that most kids especially teenagers are very picky about their food or that it's disgusting. When i was in freshman an sophmore year I would always skip to go eat because I coud'nt eat the school food, i think that kids nowadays do the same thing just so they wont starve.\n\nIn my honest opinion i belive that changing the school food would be a great idea because most kids dont concentrate in class, parents worry about their kids, and also they it would make a great impact on the schhol. Most kids at my school dont like the school lunch either, because they either think it tast wierd or just they are just picky about what they eat. I believe that by changing the menu it would would much better for parents to stop worrying about why their kids about why they dont like to eat at school. My mom almost went to put complain about the school food and that she wondered if I was the only one that would'nt eat in school.\n\nI believe that if the school cafeteria has a advantage to change the school cafeteria food because they should think about why parents worry about their kids not eating and also parents putting complaint of why their chidfren don't eat at school. I understand why most kids dont like the school food because either it doesnt have flavor or it just doesnt taste the same as before, and also sometimes the food would make me feel sick from the stomach afterwards. Parents main concern is if their kids eat or not. Normally, when I would go almost a whole day with out eating my head would hurt or stomach and i know most teenagers in my school can relate also because they prefer to starve and not eat the food that the school serves. Ever since i started school i never liked the school lunch, i would always go the whole day without eating and I would'nt take a snack or anything so it could sustain in my stomach. Sometimes even the parents say something to their kids because they dont eat in school.\n\nWhen i would go to middle school and the beginning of high school my parents would always wonder why I woud'nt eat at school, they got to a point where they thought i was depressed and i would always get yelled at because they thought something was wrong with me when in reality i just didnt like the school lunch. If the school cafeteria plans to change the cafeteria food it would be really great because more kids will be able to concentrate",

Many students become unenthused with the same meals, and it affects their performance in school. Further, schools should also introduce alternative options such as healthier protein bars and smoothies.

Everyone goes through something, tough problems can happen to anyone you just need to keep your head up and do what is right.. Not all problems have an easy choice but they bring out the best in you and help will help you in some way, they build your character.\n\nSome problems may seem impossible to fix but hard times bring the best out of you, and you'll try to fix it. Some things may seem impossible to fix but hard times bring the best out of you, you'll try hard to fix it. You can't prevent problems from happening but you can have less you you do things correct the first time around. We should show our best when problems come up due to the fact that sometimes there are problems that can put you in danger or hurt you. It doesn't matter the size of a problem, you should never underestimate them. There are both big and small problems but a problem is a problem you can't prevent them from happening. Sometimes things do not turn out how you want to be, and you learn more about the things you will do to make things easier.\n\nThere are times that problems involve more than one person, and won't effect you only but others as well. All you need to do is stay focus and look forward, so that you can keep your head up. You'll have to see what outcome there is to both of the situations and what is better for your future. Many people take their time when they deal with something troubling, they all have their different strategies too. When a problem occurs, do you try your best or do you simply not care? Problems are a common thing and happens to everyone, the real deal comes to how you will respond to it. It is also a chance that you could show others that you know what you are doing, after analyzing a problem you do what is best.\n\nYou learn from your mistakes to do better and you always try what's best for you, it may lead to a better path, as Duke Ellington said \"a problem is a chance for you to do your best.\"\n\nNo matter what you should always try your best, not only when a problem comes up.

An example to a problem is that you have a scholarship to a great university that is far away, but your family needs you to stay close and help them. There are people that can help you, you're never alone. you would never do something to hurt yourself on purpose, you will need to think things through to see the outcome. There are problems that make it seem that you can't handle it alone. They all have one thing in common they do what they think is best for them. They try to see if it will help them and what they could use to an advantage to be better. your education is at risk, but your family needs your help. It can be friends, or family, it could even involve people you don't know.\n\nAn example is that you got a great scholarship to the university of your dreams, but your family doesn't want you going far away and need your help. Some of these things will teach you lessons, maybe you did the wrong thing but you'll be wiser and know better.

It has allowed people to access information from all over the world, form meaningful relationships, and become more productive in various areas of life. Pioneered by Italian physicist and inventor Guglielmo Marconi, the invention of the radio set the stage for a new way of communication, and it changed the way people consumed information. Beginning in the late 1800s, inventors and engineers began to introduce radical new ideas that would change the world. Furthermore, inventors such as Alan Turing and Grace Hopper worked hard to create computers and programs that could handle large amounts of data and be useful for everyday tasks.

      "human_text": "Over the years I learned to manage a good attitude no matter what the situation may be because you never know what someone may be going through and you wouldn't want to treat them even worse than what they are going through. The reason I said it's taught me to be better is because I experienced a customer who was being really racists, although I didn't want to be respectful and I wanted to lash out I thought to myself that I needed to be the grown person and just try my best to ignore their comments and keep going on with my day because having a negative attitude can result to deeper problems and the outcome wouldn't have been the best. If your boss were to see what a good worker you are and they see how you manage certain situations they could even give you a raise because they can see the dedication you have for the job. I know sometimes all someone does is think negative and it can put them in a really low place in life but they should always know to never give up. I usually tend to give up when my classes get too stressful for me and I end up failing my class, I try my best to think of the good outcome it will bring me but sometimes I just feel like giving up because I don't think I will be someone big in the world and that is the worst mindset someone can have because as humans we all make mistakes but we should always think that we can better ourselves, if we only think negative then our situations may end up worse. I think that I need to remain positive so I can prove to those who doubted me wrong and I can show them that I am capable of doing good even without their help because in the end the only person you truly have is yourself. Sometimes life can get too stressful and there's no positive thinking involved but I really hope that everyone can think positive in certain situations and that they can continue to live happily and see that every obstacle they went through will be worth it. The reasons why they would want someone who has a good attitude is because they have to interact with people, set an example for future employers, and also to satisfy the customers. I personally expierence this because I am not the best in school and sometimes I just ask myself\n\n\"what is the point of doing all this?\". I used to work at Chipotle and having that job taught me to have patience and also maintain a good attitude towards other people, even if they didn't deserve to be treated good. The best way for you to remain positive is to remind yourself the reason why you are doing it and to show appreciation to those who never gave up on you even when you gave up on yourself. I try my best to a good role model with positive intentions because I know my younger siblings are looking up to me and I don't want to be the person who fails them.\n\nMost jobs would require for you to have a positive attitude because of the way their industry may work. Most importantly, I need to prove to myself that if I continue being positive then I will graduate and I will accomplish my goals all because I had a positive attitude rather than a negative attitude and bringing myself down. Remaining positive is really the key to accomplishing your goals.\n\nI used to be the type of person who wouldn't really have a good attitude because I was usually afraid of what people would say or I would fear that they would disrespect me because I wouldn't have my guard up. Personally I think that having a good attitude can take you far in life. For some jobs you really have to face hard obstacles and it could get tiring and you would just want to give up but people should always remember that all the hard work you're doing now will be worth it in the end and they would be able to see their accomplishments.\n\nFinally, I think school is the hardest place to remain positive because it brings so much stress to certain people that they don't know how to cope with it. Although at jobs sometimes it can be hard to remain positive because of the situations some customers or even coworkers put you in but I personally think sometimes as individuals we need to put out pride aside and be the bigger person and resolve the issues or just walk away without adding more problems. Many people have positive attitudes because it can have a good outcome in the long run and help them in their future. As an example right now I don't think I did good on this essay but i'm going to be thinking that I tried my best and if anything I could always try again until I get it right.\n\nIn conclusion as individuals we should always remain positive and keep trying our best because in the end it will all be worth it, even if it takes days, months, or even years. To be successful in life you have to keep trying until you get it right and you acknowledge those situations and you have the mindset that you can really accomplish thing if you put your mind and attitude first.. A positive attitude is the key to success in life because it can lead you to having a good job, being well respected by others, having others look up to you, and you should never give up on yourself. My mom is the person who's always told me to treat others the same way you would like to be treated and ever since i've always kept that in mind and tried my best to remain positive",

You can learn new things with other people that you did not already know or you can teach them something but at some point the whole group teaches everyone somehting new.\n\nWorking in a group you would probaly be pressured to stop being foolish and get your part done but if you have nice teamates then someone can help you with your part. Working in a group has more benefits then working alone because working alone you have to do everything on your own and with a group they can all help.. When working with a group there has to be self control because if the group is just being goofy then they would not get work done and they can get a bad grade and not work together in that class ever again. Helping each other is one of the easiest way to get done with something but working alone you may take longer because you have to search up things and some times they do not know where to start.\n\nTeachers put students in a group to see how they act around each other like if they act goofy or if they do not have self control. Some people, perfer to work alone because they do not like to be pressured for no reason but in some ocasions those people are the one's to turn in late work or has incorrect information. Working with a group has more benefits then working alone because with a group you can all help each other and learn new things, also so people can be more social and you can get the work done faster and aso there can be some pressure . The teachers see how the students act and they see who should be with who and who should not be with someone. When you work alone it can get very boring and you may need help with something but also if you are working alone you can work at your own pace. If a due date is coming up there can be so much pressure because maybe you have not even done your part or you are just lazy to do it some your teamates start to get mad at you and you do not know what to do.\n\nLearning new things can be fun with a group because you might not be shy to ask questions so you learn new things and maybe someone else from your group learn that same thing as you. Working alone the teachers know that it will be quite and they would not know how the students act with friends around or a group.\n\nWorking together is way better then working alone because you become more social and not so much of a shy person. Students learn new things when they working with people and they might not be so shy. A group can also help you focus and have a good time all at once, also they can hep with having a good grade in that class because they helped you a lot. Working with a group is not just for the work, it is for people to be social and so people can see how they act around other's. With a group you may be pressure to finish something quicker but your teamates can help you with that. If the group learn's something new then they can use that thing in the future when they work alone or with a different group",

For example, teams may benefit from having a clear leader and consistent goals. Teachers can also assign certain tasks to certain individuals to ensure the team is on track and working in a collaborative way.. In order for groups to maximize their productivity, teachers need to structure groups in ways that are most effective for the students. Working with a group gives people the opportunity to find help and support from others, whereas working alone can often be overwhelming and difficult",

One time I was at school and my sister was in the hospital but I could not be at the hospital with her because I had three sol's that week. We can prepare for college, be with our family, and work while we are in the program. In my opinon, we have to work hard to get what we want, and what ever is that we are working for, will come with lots of blessings.\n\nIn conclusion, we should have a program in our school so that we can grow more as professionals and have more responsabilties. Therefore, I think that having the program in our high school can benefit us. Everyday when I got out of school she was already asleep and wouldn't wake-up until the next morning, she had neumonia so we could barely talk a litlle bit. My point is that if I or my brother had the choice to be in the program we could've be with our sister because we wouldv'e been out at 1:30pm.\n\nMy last reason, is that having a program also helps us to have more time in the afternoon to work and help our family with families with their bills and their needs. He kept searchign for colleges that offered a basketball course and he had found out that our school had a program for basketball. We can also, save money for our college and for our selfs too. Some ways that it can benefit us by preparing us to go to college, it gives us more time to be with our family during the weekday, and it gives us time to work.\n\nPreparing for college, can be very emotional and physically exausted. One example I have about getting ready to go to college is that once upon a time, my big brother was going to college and his GPA was 2.9 he was so anxious because he couldn't get to any if the colleges that he really wanted to go to. Also, we can helps those who are still in ninth, tenth, or eleventh grade accompish their goals same way as we did but, we have to be thankful with those who helped us reached our goals. In my opinion, most of the students are finish with their corse classe already by their junior year. Some of the reason is that we are worring on which college we want to study or does your \"GPA\" is sufficient good that any college will accept us",

With the implementation of this program, a high school could provide these valuable life lessons to their students, helping them to reach their goals and create rewarding futures.. This program could help students prepare for college by giving them the opportunity to become familiar with the college setting and academic expectations. \n\nHard work is a key factor to success, and a program like this could be a blessing in teaching students this concept.

With the advent of the internet, communication has become almost instantaneous, and Now, conversations can be held with anyone in the world with ease. Technology has certainly made it easier to stay in touch with people, but it has also made it more difficult for people to really connect with one another. On social media platforms, people are often judged by their posts and likes, and this creates a false sense of security in interactions. Anonymity on the Internet can make people more likely to say things they wouldn't normally say in person. This can have an isolating effect, and can lead to decreased social skills and inability to connect with people in more meaningful ways.\n\nThe increasing presence of technology in our lives has both its advantages and disadvantages. Social media platforms have given us an easier way to share our thoughts, feelings, opinions, and even pictures with our networks.\n\nHowever, technology can also have a more detrimental effect on social interaction.

Knowledge is taught to you, but what is taught to you, you might forget it in the future. He was the creator of the space and time theories that in my opinion, I like very much.\n\nAlbert Einstein had to use imagination and knowledge at the same time in order to come up with those theories. I agree with Albert Einstein's quote,\"Imagination is more important than knowledge.\" I agree with this quote because, knowledge is building up in your mind little by little because people are teaching it to you.\n\nEven though knowledge is going to be extremely helpful in the career you desire to have, you must have imagination in order to \"look\" into the future and see yourself doing something good with your life. Imagination is better than knowledge because its there with you forever. Imagination is a real thing.
