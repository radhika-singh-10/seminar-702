Many people around the world have different character traits, Everyone is different on the way they behave around others. It is the responsibility of adults to teach their child how to behave and that is usually how their traits are formed. Friends also have an influence on how traits are formed like for example: Kindness, friendly, honest, and more. Everybody has a different character trait and I believe it is formed by our parents, brothers, or sisters. I think our character traits are formed by influences beyond our control. John Lubock mentions that "your character will be what you yourself choose to make it." I think that this quote explains that you are able to choose it by yourself. The influence mainly comes from parents and are the role models for their children. I disagree and I believe that other humans make our character traits.. These traits for formed because of school and my friends. Therefore they are formed. My character traits are quiet, funny, and calm. Our character traits are formed by influences. As children begin to go to school, most often they meet other kids and become friends
